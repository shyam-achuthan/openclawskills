**"Two truths and a lie"** - Overused, only if they have genuinely interesting items

## Verification Script

When starting, ask:

> "Before we write prompts, can you check what options are available in your app? The exact prompts change, so I want to make sure we're working with what you actually have.
>
> Either tell me the ones that appeal to you, or screenshot the prompt selection screen."

This ensures recommendations match actual available options.
