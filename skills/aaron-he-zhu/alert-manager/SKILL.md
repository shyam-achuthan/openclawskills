**With ~~SEO tool + ~~search console + ~~web crawler connected:**
Automatically monitor real-time metric feeds for ranking changes via ~~SEO tool API, indexing and coverage alerts from ~~search console, and technical health alerts from ~~web crawler. Set up automated threshold-based alerts with notification delivery.

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user to provide:
1. Current baseline metrics for alert thresholds (rankings, traffic, backlinks)
2. Critical keywords or pages to monitor
3. Alert priority levels and notification preferences
4. Historical data to understand normal fluctuation ranges
5. Manual reporting on metric changes when they check their tools

## Ranking Alert Configuration

### Critical Keywords (Immediate Alert)

| Keyword | Current | Alert If | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| best project management software | 2 | Drops to 5+ | 🔴 Critical |
| project management tools | 4 | Drops to 8+ | 🔴 Critical |

|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| agile project management | 7 | Drops out of top 10 | 🔴 High |
| kanban software | 9 | Drops out of top 10 | 🔴 High |

### Alert Response Plan

**If Critical Keyword Drops**:
1. Check if page is still indexed (site:url)
2. Look for algorithm update announcements
3. Analyze what changed in SERP
4. Review competitor ranking changes
5. Check for technical issues on page
6. Create recovery action plan within 24 hours

3. **Avoid alert fatigue** - Too many alerts = ignored alerts
4. **Document response plans** - Know what to do when alerts fire
5. **Review regularly** - Alerts need maintenance as your SEO matures
6. **Include positive alerts** - Track wins, not just problems

## Alert Threshold Recommendations

### Recommended Alert Thresholds by Metric

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Check Frequency |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Organic traffic | -15% WoW | -30% WoW | Daily |
| Average position (tracked KWs) | >3 position drop | >5 position drop | Daily |
| Pages indexed | -5% change | -20% change | Weekly |
| Crawl errors | >10 new errors | >50 new errors | Daily |
| Core Web Vitals | Any metric moves to "Needs Improvement" | Any metric moves to "Poor" | Weekly |
| Backlinks lost | >5% of total in 1 week | >15% in 1 week | Weekly |
| AI citation loss | Any key query loses citation | >20% queries lose citation | Weekly |
| Server errors (5xx) | >1% of pages | >5% of pages | Daily |
| Security issues | Any detected | Any detected | Daily |
| Manual penalty | N/A | Any notification | Daily |

## Alert Fatigue Prevention

### Alert Management Best Practices

| Practice | Why | How |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **Tiered severity** | Not all alerts need immediate action | Critical: Immediate; Warning: Review daily; Info: Weekly digest |
| **Threshold tuning** | Reduce false positives | Start conservative, tighten after 1 month of baseline data |
| **Grouping** | Prevent alert storms | Group related alerts (e.g., multiple rank drops = "ranking alert") |
| **Cooldown periods** | Avoid repeated alerts for same issue | Do not re-alert on same metric for 24-48 hours |
| **Scheduled digests** | Reduce notification volume | Batch non-urgent alerts into daily or weekly email |
| **Auto-resolution** | Close alerts when metric recovers | Track recovery and auto-close if threshold restored |

### Alert Priority Classification

| Priority | Response Time | Notification Channel | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| P0 — Emergency | Within 1 hour | SMS + Slack + Email | Site down, manual penalty, security breach |
| P1 — Urgent | Same day | Slack + Email | Major traffic drop, crawl blocked, indexing issues |
| P2 — Important | Within 48 hours | Email + Weekly digest | Rank drops, CWV degradation, backlink loss |
| P3 — Monitor | Next weekly review | Weekly digest only | Minor fluctuations, new competitor content |

## Escalation Path Templates

### Standard Escalation Flow

```
Alert Triggers -> Automated Classification -> Route by Priority

P0: Notify SEO Lead + Dev Team immediately
    -> If not acknowledged in 30 min -> Notify Engineering Manager
        -> If not resolved in 2 hours -> Notify VP/Director

P1: Notify SEO Lead
    -> If not acknowledged in 4 hours -> Notify Marketing Manager
        -> Add to next standup agenda

P2: Add to daily digest
    -> If persists >1 week -> Escalate to P1

P3: Add to weekly digest
    -> If persists >1 month -> Escalate to P2
```
