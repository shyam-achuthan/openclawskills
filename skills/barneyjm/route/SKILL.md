## Usage

### Via Shell Script

```bash
# Get driving directions
./scripts/route.sh '{
  "start_lat": 40.7128,
  "start_lon": -74.0060,
  "end_lat": 40.7589,
  "end_lon": -73.9851
}'

# Walking directions
./scripts/route.sh '{
  "start_lat": 40.7128,
  "start_lon": -74.0060,
  "end_lat": 40.7589,
  "end_lon": -73.9851,
  "mode": "foot"
}'

# With route geometry for mapping
./scripts/route.sh '{
  "start_lat": 40.7128,

{
  "distance_km": 6.8,
  "duration_minutes": 18,
  "mode": "car",
  "summary": "Head north on Broadway, then east on 42nd Street",
  "steps": [
    {
      "instruction": "Head north on Broadway",
      "distance_m": 2400,
      "duration_s": 420
