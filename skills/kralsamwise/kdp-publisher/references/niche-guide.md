## Series Strategy

**The most reliable path to consistent revenue is series publishing.**

1. Publish Book 1 in a niche (e.g., "Grade 1 Addition Workbook")
2. Track performance for 4-6 weeks
3. If > 50 sales/month: publish Book 2 (Grade 2), Book 3 (Grade 3)
4. If < 20 sales/month: cut losses, test new niche

**Proven series formulas:**
- Math: Grade K, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (7 books)
- Activity: Farm, Ocean, Space, Zoo, Holidays, Vehicles (6+ books)
- Puzzle: Vol. 1, 2, 3 (infinite) + Easy/Medium/Hard tiers
- Picture books: Same character, new lesson each book

---

## Keyword Research

**Backend keywords (7 slots, 50 chars each):**
- Use long-tail phrases, not single words ("grade 1 math addition workbook" not "math")
- Don't repeat keywords from your title (Amazon already indexes those)
- Think like a parent: "workbook for first graders", "homeschool math practice"
- Seasonal/niche variants: "christmas coloring book toddlers", "summer activity book kids"

**Category research:**
- Check BSR (Best Sellers Rank) in subcategories — anything under #5,000 indicates healthy sales
- Two categories maximum per book — choose the most specific subcategory available
- Kids activity books: Children's Books > Activities, Crafts & Games > Activity Books
- Workbooks: Books > Education & Teaching > Schools > Elementary Education

---

## Competition Analysis

**Before committing to a niche:**
1. Search your main keyword on Amazon
2. Look at the top 10 results: What are their BSRs? (Under 50,000 = healthy market)
3. Check review counts: Can you realistically compete? (Under 50 reviews = opportunity)
4. Check prices: What's the going rate? Don't undercut — match premium pricing
5. Look at covers: What color schemes and styles dominate? Design to stand out

**Red flags:**
- Top 10 all have 200+ reviews and 100+ BSR
- Category BSR is above 100,000 (low demand)
- Multiple publishers with identical designs (race to the bottom)

**Green flags:**
- Mix of 0-review and 50-review books in top 10
- BSR range 1,000-10,000 in category
- Room to differentiate with better cover or more specific sub-niche

## Revenue Benchmarks (Realistic)

| Performance Tier | Books (% of catalog) | Monthly/Book |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Duds | ~50% | $0-$50 |
| Mid performers | ~35% | $50-$200 |
| Strong | ~10% | $200-$500 |
| Winners | ~5% | $500-$2,000+ |

**Blended average with advertising:** $100-$150/book/month

**Rule of 80/20:** 80% of revenue comes from 20% of books. Publish broad, scale winners.
