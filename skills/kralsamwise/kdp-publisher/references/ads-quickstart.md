# Amazon Ads Quick-Start Guide

Set up your first KDP Sponsored Products campaign in under 20 minutes.

## Why Ads Are Non-Negotiable

Organic discovery on Amazon in 2026 is essentially zero for new books without reviews. Ads:
- Put your book in search results immediately
- Generate initial sales, which improve ranking
- Provide keyword data you can't get any other way
- Are the fastest path to the Amazon flywheel (sales → ranking → more sales)

**Budget mindset:** Treat early ad spend as market research, not pure marketing cost.

## Ad Types to Use

### Sponsored Products (Use This First — 80% of Budget)
- Appears in search results and on product pages
- Cost-per-click model (you only pay when someone clicks)
- Two targeting modes: Automatic (start here) and Manual

### Sponsored Brands (Use Later — 20% of Budget)
- Banner ads at top of search results
- Requires at least 3 books in your catalog
- Good for series promotion

Skip Lockscreen Ads until you have profitable books with reviews.

## Step 1: Set Up Your First Campaign

### Access
1. Go to KDP dashboard
2. Click "Promote and Advertise" on your published book
3. Or go directly to: advertising.amazon.com

### Campaign Settings
- **Campaign type:** Sponsored Products
- **Campaign name:** `[Book Title] - Auto Launch` (be descriptive)
- **Start date:** Today
- **End date:** No end date (run indefinitely until you pause)
- **Daily budget:** $5.00/day (start here for every new book)

- **Default bid:** $0.35 (adjust after first week)

### Ad Group Settings
- **Ad group name:** Auto
- **Product:** Select your book

Click **Launch Campaign**.

## Step 2: Week 1-2 (Let It Run)

Do not touch the campaign for 7-14 days. It needs data to optimize.

What to monitor:
- Impressions (at least 100+ per day means it's running)
- Clicks (expect 10-50 clicks per week at start)
- Orders (expect 0-5 in first week — that's normal)
- Spend (should be near your $5/day budget if relevant)

---

## Step 3: First Optimization (After 2+ Weeks)

### Access Search Term Report
1. Reports → Advertising Reports → Sponsored Products Search Term
2. Download CSV, filter by your campaign
3. Look for search terms with: clicks ≥ 5 and orders ≥ 1

### Kill Bleeders
Any search term with 8+ clicks and 0 sales:
1. Go to campaign → Negative Keywords
2. Add as Negative Exact
3. This stops wasting spend on irrelevant searches

### Create Manual Campaign with Winners
1. Create new campaign: `[Book Title] - Manual Exact`
2. Add converting search terms as Exact Match keywords
3. Set bids 10-20% higher than your auto campaign bid
4. This maximizes spend on proven converters

---

## Ongoing Optimization (Weekly, ~30 Minutes)

Run through these in order every week:

**Step 1 — Kill bleeders**
- Filter: clicks ≥ 8, orders = 0
- Add to Negative Exact in auto campaign
- Add to Negative Exact in manual campaign

**Step 2 — Reduce high ACoS bids**
- ACoS > 100%: reduce bid by 50%
- ACoS 45-100%: reduce bid by 25%

**Step 3 — Increase low ACoS bids**
- ACoS < 20%: increase bid by 20%
- These keywords are highly profitable — capture more traffic

**Step 4 — Harvest new keywords**
- From auto campaign search term report
- Any term with clicks ≥ 3 and orders ≥ 1 → add to manual campaign

**Step 5 — Product targeting (Month 2+)**
- Target competitor ASINs (books similar to yours)
- Find competitors in your category with many reviews
- Add their ASINs as product targets in a separate ad group

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| ACoS | Ad spend ÷ Ad revenue | 30-45% |
| CTR | Clicks ÷ Impressions | 0.3-0.8% |
| CPC | Cost per click | $0.20-$0.60 |
| CVR | Orders ÷ Clicks | 5-15% |

### Calculate Your Breakeven ACoS
```
Breakeven ACoS = Royalty per sale ÷ List price × 100

Example:
  Paperback price: $12.99
  Printing cost:   $3.50
  KDP fee (40%):   $5.20
  Royalty:         $4.29
  Breakeven ACoS:  $4.29 ÷ $12.99 = 33%
```

You can run above breakeven ACoS during launch (to build rank), then optimize down.

## Budget Scaling

### Per-Book Budget by Phase
| Phase | Daily Budget | Monthly |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Launch (weeks 1-4) | $5/day | $150 |
| Early optimization (month 2) | $5-10/day | $150-300 |
| Scale winner (month 3+) | $10-20/day | $300-600 |
| Pause underperformer | $0.50/day | $15 (keep some data) |

### Decision Rules
- **Pause if:** < 3 sales/month after 60 days with ads
- **Increase if:** ACoS < 30% consistently for 2+ weeks
- **Scale aggressively if:** ACoS < 20% with 10+ sales/month

---

## Targeting Strategy by Phase

### Launch (Weeks 1-4): Automatic Only
- Amazon's algorithm discovers what searches lead to your book
- Provides keyword data you couldn't guess in advance
- Run at $5/day, don't touch bids

### Build (Weeks 5-12): Auto + Manual
- Keep auto campaign running (it keeps finding new keywords)
- Add Manual Exact Match campaign with proven keywords
- Manual Phrase Match for longer-tail variations
- Start product targeting: pick 5-10 competitor ASINs

### Scale (Month 3+): Full Structure
- Auto campaign: $3/day (discovery)
- Manual Exact: $5-15/day (proven keywords)
- Product targeting: $3-5/day (competitor pages)
- Sponsored Brands: $2-3/day (if 3+ books)

---

## Example Campaign Structure (Month 3)

```
Campaign 1: "Brave Bear - Auto Discovery"
  Budget: $3/day, Auto targeting, Default bid: $0.30
  Negative: [all non-converters from first 2 months]

Campaign 2: "Brave Bear - Manual Exact Winners"
  Budget: $8/day, Manual Exact Match
  Keywords: "picture book courage", "brave bear kids book", "character book preschool"
  Bids: $0.40-$0.60 (adjust based on ACoS)

Campaign 3: "Brave Bear - Product Targeting"
  Budget: $3/day
  Targets: [competitor ASINs with 50-500 reviews in same category]
  Bid: $0.25-$0.40
```

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Turning off campaigns too early**
New campaigns need 2-4 weeks to gather data. Don't evaluate before then.

**Mistake 2: Setting bids too high or too low**
- Too high: Spend money on irrelevant clicks
- Too low: Never get impressions
- Start at $0.30-$0.40, adjust weekly

**Mistake 3: Not adding negative keywords**
Without negatives, auto campaigns will waste spend on irrelevant searches. Review weekly.

**Mistake 4: Optimizing every day**
Over-optimization prevents the algorithm from learning. Weekly reviews are sufficient.

**Mistake 5: Giving up on good books**
Most books take 3-4 months to reach their natural performance level. Be patient.

## Tracking Spreadsheet Template

Keep a simple spreadsheet per book per month:

| Month | Gross Sales | Ad Spend | ACoS | Net Royalty | Action |
|-------|------------|---------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | $45 | $150 | 333% | -$105 | Normal launch loss |
| 2 | $180 | $150 | 83% | $30 | Break-even, continue |
| 3 | $380 | $200 | 53% | $180 | Improving, increase bid on winners |
| 4 | $600 | $250 | 42% | $350 | At target, scale |
