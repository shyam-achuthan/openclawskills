## Spine Width Formulas

KDP calculates spine based on page count and paper type:

| Paper Type | Formula | Example (28 pages) |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| White, B&W interior | pages × 0.002252" | 28 × 0.002252 = 0.063" |
| Cream, B&W interior | pages × 0.002500" | 28 × 0.002500 = 0.070" |
| White, Color interior | pages × 0.002347" | 28 × 0.002347 = 0.066" |

**Minimum spine for text: 0.25"**  
(Text on spine is only legible above ~100 pages on most trim sizes)

Use the [KDP Cover Calculator](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/cover-calculator) to confirm exact dimensions before creating your cover file.

## Cover File Specifications

### Full Wrap Cover Dimensions
```
Total Width  = Back Cover Width + Spine Width + Front Cover Width + 2 × Bleed
Total Height = Trim Height + 2 × Bleed
```

**Example: 8.5×8.5, 28 pages, white color paper:**
```
Spine        = 28 × 0.002347 = 0.0657"
Total Width  = 8.5 + 0.0657 + 8.5 + 0.25  = 17.316"
Total Height = 8.5 + 0.25                  = 8.75"
```

### Cover File Requirements
- Format: PDF (preferred) or JPG/TIFF
- Color mode: RGB (not CMYK — KDP converts to CMYK internally)
- Resolution: 300 DPI minimum at final print size
- Bleed: 0.125" on all edges
- Safety margin: Keep all important content 0.125" inside trim lines
- ISBN barcode area: Leave 2" × 1.5" clear on bottom-right of back cover
- KDP overlays its own barcode — do not add a final barcode yourself

---

## Interior File Specifications

### PDF Requirements
- Format: PDF (PDF/X-1a for best results, standard PDF accepted)
- No crop marks or printer marks
- Page size must match trim size exactly (no-bleed files) or trim+bleed (bleed files)
- All fonts embedded
- Color mode: RGB for color interiors; grayscale or B&W for B&W interiors
- Resolution: 300 DPI minimum for images at final print size

### Image Resolution Guide
| Image Size in Book | Min Pixel Width |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Full page 8.5×8.5 at 300 DPI | 2550 × 2550 px |
| Full page 8.5×11 at 300 DPI | 2550 × 3300 px |
| Half page at 300 DPI | 1275+ px wide |
| Imagen default output (1024px) | ~3.4" at 300 DPI; scales acceptably to 8" |

> **Note:** Imagen 1024×1024 output is technically 128 DPI when scaled to fill an 8" page, but KDP preflight usually accepts it. For best results, upscale images to 2550px before embedding (use Pillow `resize` with `LANCZOS`).

### Page Count Rules
- **Minimum:** 24 pages (color); 48 pages (B&W)
- **Maximum:** 828 pages
- KDP prefers even page counts
- Children's picture books: typically 24-32 pages
- Activity/workbooks: 40-200 pages

- Format: EPUB 3 (preferred), MOBI, or DOCX
- Images: RGB, 72-96 DPI acceptable for ebook
- Cover image: Min 1600 px wide, max 10,000 px; JPG or PNG

---

## Royalty Calculation

### Paperback (all prices)
```
Royalty = 0.60 × (List Price - Printing Cost - Amazon Fee)
Amazon Fee = 0.15 × List Price  (included in 60% calc)
Net Royalty ≈ 0.60 × List Price - Printing Cost
```

### Ebook — 70% Royalty (requires $2.99-$9.99 price)
```
Royalty = (List Price × 0.70) - Delivery Fee
Delivery Fee ≈ $0.06/MB average
```

### Ebook — 35% Royalty (any price)
```
Royalty = List Price × 0.35
```

**Optimal pricing for picture books:**
- Paperback: $12.99-$14.99
- Ebook: $3.99-$4.99 (if offered)
