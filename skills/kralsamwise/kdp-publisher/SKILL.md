## Core Workflow

```
prompt → story generation → illustration → interior PDF → cover PDF → metadata → KDP upload
```

### Step 1 — Generate story and plan

Use `scripts/generate-book.py` for picture books. For workbooks/puzzles, use a puzzle generator tool (BookBolt, custom scripts).

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-book.py "a curious octopus who learns to share" \
  --type picture-book \
  --age-group 3-5 \
  --style watercolor \
  --output-dir output/
```

**Story requirements:**
- Title ≤ 60 characters
- 12 spreads → 24 story pages → ~28 pages total (title + dedication + The End + author bio)
- Ages 3-5: 10-20 words per spread, simple/repetitive sentences
- Ages 5-8: 20-40 words per spread, clear story arc
- Always include moral/lesson, dedication, back-cover description, 7 keywords

### Step 2 — Generate illustrations

**Critical image rules:**
- ALWAYS add "no text, no words, no letters, no writing" to every image prompt
- Define character reference (colors, features, accessories) before generating spread #1
- Reference first image style in all subsequent prompts: "match the watercolor style of page 1"
- Use 1:1 aspect ratio for 8.5×8.5 picture books; use 3:4 for 8.5×11 activity books
- Minimum 300 DPI for print — Imagen 1024px = ~3.4" at 300 DPI, which is fine for a scaled-up 8.5×8.5 page
- Inspect every image for AI text artifacts before embedding in PDF

### Step 3 — Assemble interior PDF

See `references/kdp-specs.md` for exact dimensions.

**8.5×8.5 No Bleed (picture books):**
- Page size: 612×612 pt
- Content area: 576×576 pt (0.25" margins on all sides)
- Images MUST fit within the content area — do not let image touch trim edge on a no-bleed file
- Layout: odd pages = illustration, even pages = text (or full-spread alternate)

**Text rules:**
- Embed fonts (ReportLab: register TTFont before use)
- Font size ≥ 14pt for ages 3-5; use centered text, generous leading
- No text inside AI images — overlay programmatically after generation

### Step 4 — Create cover

Use `scripts/create-cover.py` for the full wrap PDF (front + spine + back + bleed):

```bash
python3 scripts/create-cover.py \
  --title "The Curious Octopus" \
  --author "Your Name" \
  --pages 28 \
  --paper white \
  --front-image output/curious-octopus/images/cover.png \
  --back-text "Follow Otto the octopus as he discovers the joy of sharing..." \
  --output output/curious-octopus/cover.pdf
```

**Spine width formulas (KDP standard):**
- White paper B&W: pages × 0.002252 inches
- Cream paper B&W: pages × 0.0025 inches
- White paper color: pages × 0.002347 inches

**Cover dimensions (8.5×8.5, white color, 28 pages):**
- Spine width: 28 × 0.002347 = 0.0657"
- Total cover width: 8.5 + 0.0657 + 8.5 + 0.25" bleed = 17.316"
- Total cover height: 8.5 + 0.25" bleed = 8.75"

**Cover design rules:**
- Put title + author text as a PDF overlay — never bake text into the AI cover image
- Leave bottom-right 2"×1.5" of back cover clear for ISBN barcode
- Spine text is optional for books < 100 pages (too narrow to read)
- KDP will overlay its own barcode on the back cover — leave space

### Step 5 — Write metadata

**Description rules:**
- Write from the finished story, NOT from the prompt or outline
- Use character names exactly as they appear in the final text
- 2-3 sentences: hook + plot + moral/appeal
- Include age range in description text ("Perfect for ages 3-6")
- Do not keyword-stuff; Amazon indexes naturally

**KDP metadata fields:**
- Title + subtitle (subtitle is optional but good for search)
- Author: pen name
- 7 backend keywords (use all 7 slots; 50 chars each; use phrases not single words)
- 2 categories (research BSR before choosing)
- Language, publication date
- AI-generated content disclosure: required if text or images are AI-generated

### Step 6 — Validate before upload

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-book.py \
  --interior output/curious-octopus/interior.pdf \
  --cover output/curious-octopus/cover.pdf \
  --metadata output/curious-octopus/metadata.json
```

Checks: page count, trim dimensions, image resolution, no-text-in-images, description/story consistency.

### Step 7 — Upload to KDP

**Browser automation rules (critical):**
- Do NOT use Playwright `type` on KDP form fields — focus shifts and input breaks
- Use JavaScript `evaluate` with element IDs:
  ```js
  document.getElementById('data-print-book-title').value = 'The Curious Octopus';
  document.getElementById('data-print-book-title').dispatchEvent(new Event('input', {bubbles:true}));
  ```
- File uploads require CDP `DOM.setFileInputFiles` + change event (Playwright upload action doesn't work):
  ```js
  // After DOM.setFileInputFiles:
  document.querySelector('input[type=file]').dispatchEvent(new Event('change', {bubbles:true}));
  ```
- Wait for `#data-print-book-interior-processing-status` to show COMPLETED before proceeding
- Reload KDP page before each upload session — stale form state causes silent failures

**Category selection:**
- Use the cascade-select dropdowns in the category modal
- After selecting all levels, JS-click the placement checkbox (don't Playwright-click)

## Activity Books & Workbooks

For non-narrative books, skip the story generation step. Instead:

1. Plan content structure (sections, problem counts, difficulty levels)
2. Generate content programmatically or with a puzzle generator
3. Layout with ReportLab or a worksheet template
4. Apply the same cover + metadata workflow

**Math workbook rules:**
- Do NOT add answer lines below equations — kids write directly below the problem line
- Use ≥ 14pt font for problem numbers; ≥ 20pt for the math itself
- Include answer key as last section
- 8.5×11", 1" margins, B&W interior

**Coloring book rules:**
- Image prompts: "simple black and white coloring page, thick lines, no shading, age-appropriate"
- Do not use grayscale images — must be pure black line art on white background
- Leave blank back sides of pages to prevent marker bleed-through

## Key Lessons

These were learned through production and would not be obvious from KDP documentation:

1. **KDP form automation**: Use JS evaluate + element IDs. Never use browser `type` action — fields shift focus mid-input.

2. **File upload via CDP**: Standard Playwright upload fails on KDP. Use `DOM.setFileInputFiles` + dispatch change event. See TOOLS.md for full script path.

3. **Spine width formula**: White paper B&W = `pages × 0.002252`. White paper color = `pages × 0.002347`. This is what KDP Cover Calculator gives you.

4. **8.5×8.5 No Bleed margin**: Images must fit within 576×576 pt content area on a 612×612 pt page. Images touching the trim edge will fail KDP preflight.

5. **No text in AI illustrations**: Every image prompt must include "no text, no words, no letters". Text baked into AI images is often garbled. Always overlay text programmatically.

6. **Descriptions from finished content**: Never write the description from the original prompt. Write it after the story is final — use actual character names and plot.

7. **KDP categories**: Select via cascade dropdowns in the modal, then JS-click the placement checkbox. Don't rely on Playwright click for the final checkbox.

8. **Math workbooks**: No answer lines below equations. Kids write below the problem line.

9. **Stale form state**: Reload the KDP page before each upload session. Uploading a second file to a page already mid-process fails silently.

10. **AI disclosure**: Amazon requires disclosure if text OR images are AI-generated. Select Yes during upload. Non-disclosure can result in account action.
