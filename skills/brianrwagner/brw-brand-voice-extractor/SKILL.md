# Brand Voice Extractor

Generic copy converts worse than copy with a distinct voice.

Not because the words are different — because the reader feels like they're hearing from a *person*, not a marketing team.

This skill defines that voice. Either by extracting it from content you're already proud of, or building it strategically from the ground up. The output is a reusable voice profile that every content skill can reference — so your AI never sounds like everyone else's AI.

---

## What You Get

A complete **voice profile document** containing:

- Voice summary (2-3 sentences capturing the essence)
- Core personality traits with real-world implications
- Tone spectrum across 5 key dimensions
- Vocabulary guide: words to use, words to kill
- Rhythm & structure patterns
- Example phrases (on-brand vs. off-brand)
- Do's and Don'ts for any writer (human or AI)

**Result:** Anyone — or any AI agent — can read this profile and produce content that sounds unmistakably like you.

---

## Two Modes

### Mode 1: Extract
**Use when:** You have existing content that already sounds right.

Feed the skill 3-5 pieces of content you're proud of — website copy, emails, posts, newsletter editions, anything where you thought *"yes, this is me."*

The skill analyzes patterns across tone, vocabulary, rhythm, structure, and POV, then codifies what makes your writing distinctive.

**Best inputs:**
- Your About page or homepage copy
- Your top-performing social posts
- Emails where you nailed the tone
- Newsletter editions you felt good about
- Video or podcast transcripts

### Mode 2: Build
**Use when:** You're starting fresh, your existing content is generic, or you want to evolve your voice strategically.

The skill asks 10-15 targeted questions about your personality, audience, positioning, and aspirations — then constructs a voice aligned with who you are and who you're talking to.

**How to choose:**

> "Do you have existing content that represents how you want to sound?"
> - Yes → **Extract mode**
> - No / Not sure → **Build mode**

---

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Choose your mode
Tell the agent: *"Run the brand-voice-extractor in Extract mode"* or *"Build mode."*

### Step 2: Provide inputs
- **Extract:** Paste 3-5 pieces of content
- **Build:** Answer the 10-15 questions the agent asks

### Step 3: Receive your voice profile
The agent outputs a complete, formatted voice profile document.

### Step 4: Save it
Store the profile somewhere accessible (e.g., `brand/VOICE-PROFILE.md` in your workspace). Reference it in every future content task.

### Step 5: Reference it in other skills
> "Write 5 LinkedIn posts using this voice profile: [paste profile]"
> "Draft an email sequence. Use my voice profile for tone and style."
> "Rewrite this landing page to match my voice."

1. What are 3-5 words that describe your personality?
2. What do you stand for? What's your core belief about your industry?
3. What's your background? What shaped how you see things?
4. What makes you genuinely different from others in your space?

**Audience (who you're talking to)**
5. Who are you talking to? (Be specific — not "entrepreneurs")
6. What tone resonates with them? What do they respond to?
7. What would make them trust you? What would turn them off?

**Positioning (how you show up)**
8. Are you the expert, the peer, the rebel, the guide, the insider?
9. Where do you sit on accessible ↔ exclusive?
10. Where do you sit on approachable ↔ authoritative?

**Aspiration (what you want to sound like)**
11. Name 2-3 people or brands whose voice you admire. What specifically?
12. What do you NOT want to sound like?

## Quality Bar

A good voice profile passes this test:

✅ **Recognizable** — Could someone identify content as "yours" without a byline?
✅ **Actionable** — Could a writer (human or AI) produce on-brand content using only this profile?
✅ **Differentiated** — Does it sound different from competitors?
✅ **Authentic** — Does it feel true to who you are?
✅ **Consistent** — Can it apply across formats (social, email, long-form)?

If any answer is no, the profile needs more specificity.

Voice profile → **email-sequences:** "Draft this sequence. Match my voice."
Voice profile → **lead-magnet:** "Frame the lead magnet to match this voice."

**The workflow:** Run brand-voice-extractor first → Save the profile → Reference it in everything else.
