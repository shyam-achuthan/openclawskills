## The Problem

Generic AI copy is everywhere. It's trained on the same data, uses the same phrases, hits the same notes. Your audience can feel it — and it erodes trust.

The fix isn't better prompting. It's giving your AI a framework it can follow every time.

## What This Skill Does

Brand Voice Extractor produces a **complete voice profile** from either:
- Content you already love (Extract mode)
- Strategic questions about who you are and who you serve (Build mode)

The output is a reusable document — personality traits, tone spectrum, vocabulary guide, rhythm patterns, example phrases — that any AI agent can reference to produce on-brand content, consistently.

## What You Get

- ✅ Voice summary (2-3 sentences that capture the essence)
- ✅ Core personality traits with real-world implications
- ✅ Tone spectrum across 5 dimensions
- ✅ Vocabulary: words to use, words to kill
- ✅ Rhythm and structure patterns
- ✅ Example phrases: on-brand vs. off-brand
- ✅ Do's and Don'ts your AI can follow on every task

## Two Modes

**Extract mode** — Feed it 3-5 pieces of content you're proud of. It analyzes tone, vocabulary, rhythm, structure, and POV, then codifies what makes your writing distinctive.

**Build mode** — Answer 10-15 targeted questions about your personality, audience, and positioning. It constructs a voice aligned with who you are and who you're talking to.

## How to Use It

1. Load `SKILL.md` into your AI agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Copilot, etc.)
2. Tell it: "Run brand-voice-extractor in Extract mode" or "Build mode"
3. Provide inputs (content samples or question answers)
4. Save the voice profile output
5. Reference the profile in every content task going forward

## Pairs With

- `direct-response-copy` — Write landing pages in your voice
- `content-atomizer` — Repurpose content that sounds like you
- `email-sequences` — Sequences in your tone, not generic AI tone
- `lead-magnet` — Lead magnets that feel like your best work

## The Quality Bar

A good voice profile means: someone could read your content without a byline and know it was you. That's the test. If the profile doesn't get you there, the skill tells you what's missing.
