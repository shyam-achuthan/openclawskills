## Executive Summary

This audit covers the Torch Prediction Market Kit v1.0.0, an autonomous bot that creates binary prediction markets as Torch tokens, monitors them, and resolves them using oracle price feeds. The bot was reviewed for key safety, vault integration correctness, oracle security, error handling, and dependency surface.

The bot is **vault-first** (all value routes through the vault PDA), **disposable-key** (agent keypair generated in-process, holds nothing), and **single-purpose** (create markets, monitor, resolve — no trading, no arbitrage).

### Overall Assessment

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Key Safety | **PASS** | In-process `Keypair.generate()`, no key files, no key logging |
| Vault Integration | **PASS** | `vault` param correctly passed to `buildBuyTransaction` |
| Oracle Security | **PASS** | Read-only CoinGecko API, no credentials, graceful failure |
| Error Handling | **PASS** | Cycle-level catch, per-market try/catch |
| Config Validation | **PASS** | Required env vars checked, scan interval floored at 5000ms |
| File I/O | **PASS** | markets.json read/write with proper JSON serialization |
| Dependencies | **MINIMAL** | 2 runtime deps, both pinned exact |
| Supply Chain | **LOW RISK** | No post-install hooks, no remote code fetching |

### Finding Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 |
| Medium | 0 |
| Low | 2 |
| Informational | 4 |

### SDK Cross-Reference

The bot relies on `torchsdk@3.2.3` for all on-chain interaction. The SDK was independently audited (see [Torch SDK Audit](https://torch.market/audit.md)). This audit focuses on the bot's usage of the SDK, not the SDK internals.

---

## Methodology

1. **Line-by-line source review** of all 6 bot source files
2. **Keypair lifecycle analysis** — generation, usage, exposure surface
3. **Vault integration verification** — correct params passed to SDK
4. **Oracle security review** — external API surface, failure modes, data flow
5. **File I/O analysis** — markets.json read/write safety
6. **Error handling analysis** — crash paths, retry behavior, log safety
7. **Dependency audit** — runtime deps, dev deps, post-install hooks
8. **E2E test review** — coverage, assertions, false positives

---

## Keypair Safety Review

### Generation

The keypair is created in `main()` via one of two paths:

1. **Default (recommended):** `Keypair.generate()` — fresh Ed25519 keypair from system entropy
2. **Optional:** `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` env var — loaded as JSON byte array or base58, decoded via `Keypair.fromSecretKey()`

The keypair is:

- **Not persisted** — exists only in runtime memory (unless user provides `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`)
- **Not exported** — `agentKeypair` is local to `main()`, not in the public API
- **Not logged** — only the public key is printed (`agentKeypair.publicKey.toBase58()`)
- **Not transmitted** — the secret key never leaves the process

### Usage

The keypair is used in exactly three places:

1. **Public key extraction** (startup logging, vault link check, transaction params) — safe, public key only
2. **Token creation signing** (`createResult.transaction.sign(agentKeypair)` in markets.ts) — local signing only
3. **Buy transaction signing** (`buyResult.transaction.sign(agentKeypair)` in markets.ts) — local signing only

**Verdict:** Key safety is correct. No key material leaks from the process.

---

## Vault Integration Review

### Startup Verification

```typescript
const vault = await getVault(connection, config.vaultCreator)  // index.ts:137
if (!vault) throw new Error(...)

const link = await getVaultForWallet(connection, agentKeypair.publicKey.toBase58())  // index.ts:144
if (!link) { /* print instructions, exit */ }
```

The bot verifies both vault existence and agent linkage before entering the market cycle.

### Seed Liquidity Transaction

```typescript
const buyResult = await buildBuyTransaction(connection, {
  mint: mintAddress,
  buyer: agentKeypair.publicKey.toBase58(),
  amount_sol: market.initialLiquidityLamports,
  slippage_bps: 500,
  vault: vaultCreator,  // markets.ts:66
})
```

The `vault` parameter is correctly passed. Per the SDK, this causes:
- Vault PDA derived from `vaultCreator` (`["torch_vault", creator]`)
- Wallet link PDA derived from `buyer` (`["vault_wallet", wallet]`)
- SOL debited from vault, tokens credited to vault ATA

**Verdict:** Vault integration is correct. All value routes through the vault PDA.

---

## Market Cycle Security

### Error Isolation

```typescript
// Cycle level — never crashes the loop
while (true) {
  try {
    await marketCycle(connection, log, config.marketsPath, config.vaultCreator, agentKeypair)
  } catch (err: any) {
    log('error', `market cycle error: ${err.message}`)
  }
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, config.scanIntervalMs))
}
```

### Per-Market Isolation

```typescript
for (const market of markets) {
  try {
    // create / snapshot / resolve logic
  } catch (err: any) {
    log('warn', `ERROR | ${market.id} — ${err.message}`)
  }
}
```

Each failed market operation is logged as a warning and the loop continues to the next market.

### File I/O Safety

```typescript
// Read
const raw = fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf-8')
const definitions = JSON.parse(raw)

// Write
fs.writeFileSync(path, JSON.stringify(markets, null, 2) + '\n', 'utf-8')
```

- File reads are synchronous — no race conditions with concurrent writes
- JSON.parse is wrapped in the cycle-level try/catch
- File writes use atomic `writeFileSync` — no partial writes
- The `dirty` flag ensures writes only happen when state actually changes

**Verdict:** Error handling is robust. The bot degrades gracefully at every level.

---

## Oracle Security

### CoinGecko Price Feed

The oracle module makes one external API call:

```
GET https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids={asset}&vs_currencies=usd
```

#### Data Flow Analysis

| Direction | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Sent to CoinGecko** | Asset ID only (e.g. `"solana"`) — no wallet, transaction, agent, or user data |
| **Received from CoinGecko** | `{ "solana": { "usd": 87.76 } }` — price only |

#### Security Properties

- **No API key required** — uses the free public endpoint
- **No credentials sent** — no auth headers, no cookies, no tokens
- **Read-only** — GET request only, no mutations
- **No private data transmitted** — asset ID is public knowledge
- **Graceful failure** — if CoinGecko returns non-200, `checkPriceFeed` throws. The market stays unresolved and the bot retries next cycle.
- **No price data cached** — fresh fetch on every resolution check

#### Attack Surface

| Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| CoinGecko returns wrong price | Market resolves incorrectly | Oracle is best-effort; manual override available via JSON edit |
| CoinGecko unreachable | Market stays unresolved | Bot retries next cycle; no data loss |
| Man-in-the-middle | Fabricated price | HTTPS enforced; resolution is informational only (no payout) |

The oracle is informational — it records an outcome but does not trigger payouts. An incorrect resolution has no financial impact beyond the recorded outcome.

### Manual Oracle

Returns `'unresolved'` — the bot takes no action. Resolution requires manual JSON editing by the operator.

**Verdict:** Oracle security is appropriate for the token-as-signal model. No credentials transmitted, graceful failure, and no financial impact from incorrect resolution.

---

## Configuration Validation

### Required Variables

| Variable | Validation | Failure Mode |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `SOLANA_RPC_URL` | Must be set (fallback: `RPC_URL`) | Throws on startup |
| `VAULT_CREATOR` | Must be set | Throws on startup |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL_MS` | Must be >= 5000 | Throws on startup |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Must be `debug\|info\|warn\|error` | Throws on startup |
| `MARKETS_PATH` | Defaults to `./markets.json` | Uses default |

### Security Notes

- `SOLANA_RPC_URL` is used only for Solana RPC calls — never logged or transmitted externally
- `VAULT_CREATOR` is a public key (not sensitive)
- `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` is optional — if provided, read once and used for `Keypair.fromSecretKey()`. Never logged or transmitted.
- `MARKETS_PATH` is a local file path — no remote file fetching

**Verdict:** Configuration is properly validated. No sensitive data exposure.

## Dependency Analysis

### Runtime Dependencies

| Package | Version | Pinning | Post-Install | Risk |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|------|
| `@solana/web3.js` | 1.98.4 | Exact | None | Low — standard Solana |
| `torchsdk` | 3.2.3 | Exact | None | Low — audited separately |

### Node.js Built-ins Used

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `fs` | Read/write markets.json |
| `fetch` | CoinGecko API (global in Node 18+) |

### Supply Chain

- **No `^` or `~` version ranges** — all dependencies pinned to exact versions
- **No post-install hooks** — `"scripts"` contains only `build`, `clean`, `test`, `format`
- **No remote code fetching** — no dynamic `import()`, no `eval()`, no fetch-and-execute
- **Lockfile present** — `pnpm-lock.yaml` pins transitive dependencies

### External Runtime Dependencies

| Service | Purpose | When Called | Bot Uses? |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **CoinGecko** (`api.coingecko.com`) | Asset price for oracle resolution + SOL/USD display | `checkPriceFeed()` in oracle.ts, `getToken()` in SDK | **Yes** — oracle + token queries |
| **Irys Gateway** (`gateway.irys.xyz`) | Token metadata fallback | `getToken()` when URI points to Irys | Yes — via `getToken()` |
| **SAID Protocol** (`api.saidprotocol.com`) | Agent identity verification | `verifySaid()` only | **No** — bot does not call `verifySaid()` |

**Important:** `confirmTransaction()` does NOT contact SAID Protocol. It only calls `connection.getParsedTransaction()` (Solana RPC).

**Verdict:** Minimal and locked dependency surface. No supply chain concerns.

---

## Threat Model

### Threat: Compromised Agent Keypair

**Attack:** Attacker obtains the agent's private key from process memory.
**Impact:** Attacker can sign transactions as the agent — create tokens, buy via vault.
**Mitigation:** The agent keypair holds ~0.01 SOL. The vault's value is controlled by the authority, who can unlink the compromised wallet in one transaction. The attacker cannot call `withdrawVault` or `withdrawTokens`.
**Residual risk:** Attacker could create unwanted tokens and drain vault SOL via buys until unlinked. Limited by vault balance and authority response time.

### Threat: Malicious RPC Endpoint

**Attack:** RPC returns fabricated token data or transaction results.
**Impact:** Bot might create tokens with incorrect state or submit transactions that fail.
**Mitigation:** Token creation and buys are validated on-chain. A fabricated RPC response would produce transactions that fail on-chain.
**Residual risk:** None — on-chain validation is the actual security boundary.

### Threat: CoinGecko API Manipulation

**Attack:** CoinGecko returns an incorrect price, causing wrong market resolution.
**Impact:** Market resolved with incorrect outcome.
**Mitigation:** Token-as-signal model — no payouts. Incorrect resolution is informational only. Operator can manually correct by editing markets.json.
**Residual risk:** Reputational — markets resolved incorrectly lose credibility.

### Threat: Markets.json Tampering

**Attack:** Attacker modifies markets.json to inject malicious market definitions.
**Impact:** Bot creates unintended tokens and spends vault SOL on seed liquidity.
**Mitigation:** File permissions. The bot runs locally. Markets.json should be readable/writable only by the operator.
**Residual risk:** If the attacker has filesystem access, they likely have more valuable targets.

### Threat: Front-Running

**Attack:** MEV bot observes the seed liquidity buy and front-runs it.
**Impact:** Bot buys at a worse price, getting fewer tokens for the seed.
**Mitigation:** 5% slippage tolerance (500 bps). For small seed amounts (0.1 SOL), MEV extraction is negligible.
**Residual risk:** Slightly worse execution on seed buys.

## Findings

### L-1: No Timeout on SDK Calls

**Severity:** Low
**File:** `markets.ts`, `index.ts`
**Description:** SDK calls (`buildCreateTokenTransaction`, `buildBuyTransaction`, `getToken`, `getHolders`) and the CoinGecko fetch have no explicit timeout. A hanging RPC endpoint or unresponsive API could block the market cycle indefinitely.
**Impact:** Bot stalls until the connection times out at the TCP level.
**Recommendation:** Wrap SDK calls and fetch in a `Promise.race` with a timeout (e.g., 30 seconds per call).

### L-2: No Market ID Uniqueness Validation

**Severity:** Low
**File:** `markets.ts:22-34`
**Description:** `loadMarkets()` does not validate that market IDs are unique. Duplicate IDs could cause both markets to be created, with the second overwriting the first's state on save.
**Impact:** Duplicate market creation, wasted vault SOL.
**Recommendation:** Add duplicate ID check in `loadMarkets()`.

### I-1: CoinGecko Rate Limiting

**Severity:** Informational
**Description:** CoinGecko's free tier allows ~10-30 requests per minute. With many markets resolving simultaneously, the bot could hit rate limits.
**Impact:** Some markets may fail to resolve in a single cycle. They'll retry next cycle.

### I-2: No Market Count Limit

**Severity:** Informational
**Description:** The bot processes all markets in markets.json with no limit. A very large file could cause slow cycle times.
**Impact:** Slow cycles, not a security issue.

### I-3: Surfpool getTokenLargestAccounts Limitation

**Severity:** Informational
**Description:** `getHolders` fails on Surfpool because `getTokenLargestAccounts` returns an internal error for Token-2022 tokens. Works on mainnet.
**Impact:** Test coverage limitation only.

### I-4: Oracle Resolution is One-Shot

**Severity:** Informational
**Description:** When a market's deadline passes, the oracle is checked once per cycle. If the oracle returns `'unresolved'` (manual oracle), the market stays active and the oracle is re-checked every cycle.
**Impact:** Manual markets require JSON editing. No security issue — this is by design.

---

## Conclusion

The Torch Prediction Market Kit v1.0.0 is a well-structured, minimal-surface market maker with correct vault integration, appropriate oracle security, and robust error handling. Key findings:

1. **Key safety is correct** — in-process `Keypair.generate()` by default. No key logging, no key transmission.
2. **Vault integration is correct** — `vault` param passed to `buildBuyTransaction`, SOL from vault, tokens to vault ATA.
3. **Oracle security is appropriate** — CoinGecko read-only, no credentials, graceful failure. Token-as-signal model means no financial impact from incorrect resolution.
4. **Error handling is robust** — three levels of isolation (cycle, market, operation). No single failure crashes the bot.
5. **Dependency surface is minimal** — 2 runtime deps, both pinned exact, no post-install hooks.
6. **No critical, high, or medium findings** — 2 low, 4 informational.

The bot is safe for production use as an autonomous prediction market creator operating through a Torch Vault.
