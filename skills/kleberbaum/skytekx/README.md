# Skytekx

**See your cloud clearly.**

## What We Monitor

- Compute (instances, containers, serverless)
- Storage and database resources
- Network traffic and latency
- Cost and budget thresholds

## Setup

1. Configure cloud provider credentials (AWS/GCP/Azure).
2. Install Skytekx via ClawHub.
3. Run `cloud-watch.sh --dashboard` to verify connectivity.

## Alerting

Define rules for CPU, memory, disk, and custom metrics. Skytekx supports webhooks and integrations with popular incident tools.
