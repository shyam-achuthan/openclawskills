# Policy Writer

Generate professional internal business policies in seconds — HR, IT, finance, data privacy, compliance, acceptable use, and more.

No templates to fill. No consulting fees. Just tell your agent what policy you need and get a complete, enforceable document.

## What It Does

- Generates complete policy documents with proper structure
- Covers scope, enforcement, compliance references, review schedules
- Adapts to company size (startup-lean to enterprise-comprehensive)
- References relevant regulations (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA, ISO 27001)

## Example Policies You Can Generate

- Data Retention & Privacy Policy
- Acceptable Use Policy
- Information Security Policy
- Expense & Travel Policy
- Code of Conduct
- Incident Response Policy
