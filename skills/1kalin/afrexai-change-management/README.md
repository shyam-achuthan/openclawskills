# Change Management Planner

Stop winging organizational change. This skill turns your AI agent into a change management consultant — structured frameworks, stakeholder analysis, communication plans, and rollout timelines.

## Why This Exists

70% of change initiatives fail. Usually because someone skipped the stakeholder analysis, botched the communication, or didn't plan for resistance. This skill forces the right structure.

## What You Get

- **Stakeholder impact mapping** with resistance scoring
- **Communication plans** tailored by audience level
- **Phased rollout** with go/no-go gates
- **Resistance playbook** — anticipated objections + specific counters
- **Success metrics** — adoption, productivity, sentiment at 30/60/90 days
- **Three frameworks**: ADKAR, Kotter's 8-Step, Lewin's model

## Use Cases

- ERP/CRM/AI tool rollouts
- Team restructuring
- Process overhauls
- M&A integration
- Remote-to-hybrid transitions

## Quick Start
