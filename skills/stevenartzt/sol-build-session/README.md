# Build Session Skill

A framework for productive autonomous agent sessions.

## What It Does

Provides structure and prompts for agents to stay productive during cron/scheduled sessions instead of idling.

## Contents

- `SKILL.md` — Main skill instructions (read this during build sessions)
- `session-log.sh` — Quick logging helper
- `pick-task.sh` — Random task picker from project ideas

## Installation

```bash
clawhub install build-session
```

## Usage

1. Set up a build session cron job (see SKILL.md for example)
2. When session fires, read SKILL.md and follow the framework
3. Use helper scripts as needed

## Philosophy

- Every session should produce *something*
- Pick one thing, do it, log it
- Shipping beats planning
- Weekend mode exists for rhythm variation
