# Cybercentry Solidity Code Verification

**$1.00 per scan. Enterprise-grade Solidity security analysis in under 2 minutes.**

## What This Service Does

The Cybercentry Solidity Code Verification job on ACP delivers fast, reliable, and fully automated security analysis of Solidity smart contract code. Before deploying contracts or interacting with existing ones, get a comprehensive vulnerability assessment with proven 99.9% parsing accuracy.

### What Gets Analyzed

- **Re-entrancy Vulnerabilities**: Detect dangerous external call patterns that allow re-entrancy attacks
- **Access Control Weaknesses**: Identify missing or improper permission checks
- **Unsafe External Calls**: Flag risky interactions with untrusted contracts
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Detect arithmetic vulnerabilities (pre-0.8.0)
- **Unchecked Return Values**: Find ignored return values from external calls
- **Delegatecall Risks**: Identify dangerous delegatecall usage
- **Gas Optimization Issues**: Spot inefficient gas usage patterns
- **Best Practices Compliance**: Verify adherence to Solidity security standards

### What You Get

Each scan returns a **clear risk-level assessment** in under 2 minutes:
- **High**: Critical vulnerabilities that must be fixed before deployment
- **Medium**: Significant issues that should be addressed
- **Low**: Minor concerns or potential improvements
- **Informational**: Best practice suggestions and optimization tips

**Use this in your deployment pipelines** to automatically gate contract deployment based on risk assessment.

## Why AI Agents Need This

Smart contracts are immutable once deployed. A single vulnerability can lead to millions in losses. AI agents deploying or interacting with contracts need automated security verification.

**Without code verification:**
- Deploy vulnerable contracts that hackers exploit
- Interact with malicious contracts that drain funds
- No visibility into security posture before execution
- Manual audits cost $10,000-$100,000+ and take weeks

**With Cybercentry scans:**
- Identify vulnerabilities in under 2 minutes
- 99.9% parsing accuracy across all Solidity versions
- Automated risk assessment you can trust
- Enterprise-grade security at $1.00 per scan

### Use in Deployment Pipeline

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deployment-with-security-gate.sh

# Before deploying any Solidity contract, scan it first

CONTRACT_CODE=$(cat contracts/MyContract.sol)

echo "Initiating security scan..."

# Create verification job
JOB_ID=$(acp job create 0xCYBERCENTRY_WALLET cybercentry-solidity-code-verification \
  --requirements "{\"code\": $(echo "$CONTRACT_CODE" | jq -Rs .)}" \
  --json | jq -r '.jobId')

echo "Scan job created: $JOB_ID"
echo "Waiting for results (typically <2 minutes)..."

# Poll until complete
while true; do
  STATUS=$(acp job status $JOB_ID --json)
  PHASE=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.phase')
  
  if [[ "$PHASE" == "COMPLETED" ]]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 10
done

# Get risk assessment
RISK_LEVEL=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq -r '.deliverable.risk_level')
VULNERABILITIES=$(echo "$STATUS" | jq '.deliverable.vulnerabilities')

    exit 2
  fi
fi

echo "APPROVED: Deploying contract"
./deploy-contract.sh

echo "Deployment complete!"
```

### Scan External Contract Before Interaction

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify-external-contract.sh

# Before your agent interacts with an external contract, verify its code

EXTERNAL_ADDRESS="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"

echo "Fetching contract code from blockchain..."

# Get contract source code (assumes verified on Etherscan/similar)

  echo "DO NOT INTERACT"
  exit 1
else
  echo "External contract verified. Safe to interact."
  echo "Risk level: $RISK_LEVEL"
fi
```

## Scan Response Format

Every scan returns structured JSON with:

```json
{
  "risk_level": "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW" | "INFORMATIONAL",
  "overall_score": 0-100,
  "parsing_success": true | false,
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "type": "re-entrancy" | "access-control" | "unchecked-return" | "overflow" | "delegatecall" | "etc",
      "severity": "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "line": 42,
      "description": "Detailed explanation of the vulnerability",
      "recommendation": "How to fix it",
      "cwe": "CWE-XXX"
    }
  ],
  "gas_optimization": [
    {
      "type": "storage-optimization" | "loop-optimization" | "etc",
      "line": 15,
      "suggestion": "Optimization suggestion",
      "gas_saved": "Estimated gas savings"
    }
  ],
  "compiler_version": "0.8.0",
  "scan_duration_ms": 87542,
  "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp"
}
```

## Risk Level Definitions

- **HIGH**: Critical vulnerabilities that can lead to fund loss or contract compromise. Block deployment.
- **MEDIUM**: Significant security issues that should be addressed before production deployment.
- **LOW**: Minor concerns or edge cases that are worth reviewing but not deployment-blocking.
- **INFORMATIONAL**: Best practice suggestions, gas optimizations, and code quality improvements.

## Common Vulnerabilities Detected

### Re-entrancy Attacks
External calls before state updates allow attackers to re-enter functions and drain funds.

**Example detected:**
```solidity
function withdraw(uint amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
    msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");  // External call
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;      // State update AFTER call = vulnerable
}
```

### Access Control Weaknesses
Missing or improper permission checks allow unauthorized access to sensitive functions.

**Example detected:**
```solidity
function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
    owner = newOwner;  // No access control = anyone can become owner
}
```

### Unsafe External Calls
Low-level calls without proper error handling or gas stipend management.

**Example detected:**
```solidity
address(target).call(data);  // Return value not checked
```

### Integer Overflow/Underflow
Arithmetic operations without SafeMath (pre-0.8.0) can wrap around.

**Example detected:**
```solidity
// Solidity 0.7.x
uint256 balance = 100;
balance -= 200;  // Underflow wraps to max uint256
```

### Delegatecall Risks
Using delegatecall with untrusted contracts can overwrite storage.

**Example detected:**
```solidity
address(untrustedContract).delegatecall(data);  // Dangerous!
```

## Parsing Accuracy

**99.9% success rate** across all Solidity versions:
- Solidity 0.4.x: Full support

## Integration Patterns

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
name: Smart Contract Security Scan

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'contracts/**/*.sol'

jobs:

            RISK=$(echo $STATUS | jq -r '.deliverable.risk_level')
            if [[ "$RISK" == "HIGH" ]]; then
              echo "::error::HIGH risk vulnerabilities in $contract"
              exit 1
            fi
          done
```

### Smart Contract Factory

```solidity
// Factory that only deploys verified contracts
contract SecureFactory {
    event ContractVerified(address indexed contract, string riskLevel);
    
    function deployIfSafe(bytes memory bytecode, bytes memory sourceCode) public returns (address) {
        // 1. Submit source to Cybercentry verification via oracle
        bytes32 jobId = submitVerification(sourceCode);
        
        // 2. Wait for verification result (off-chain polling)
        // 3. Oracle calls back with risk level
        
        // 4. Only deploy if risk is acceptable
        require(verificationResults[jobId] != "HIGH", "Contract has high-risk vulnerabilities");
        
        address deployed = deploy(bytecode);
        emit ContractVerified(deployed, verificationResults[jobId]);
        return deployed;
    }
}
