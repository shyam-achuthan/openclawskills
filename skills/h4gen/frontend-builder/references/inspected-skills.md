# Inspected Upstream Skills

Directly inspected from ClawHub:

- `frontend-design-ultimate` latest `1.0.0`
- `shadcn-ui` latest `1.0.0`
- `react-expert` latest `0.1.0`

## Relevant Capability Notes

- `frontend-design-ultimate` provides anti-generic design workflow, strong aesthetic direction, responsive patterns, and React/Tailwind/shadcn-oriented implementation guidance.
- `shadcn-ui` provides concrete install commands and component composition patterns; components are copied into project code rather than consumed as a hosted UI runtime.
- `react-expert` provides strict React implementation constraints (typed components, hooks discipline, maintainability/performance guardrails).

This meta-skill composes these three roles; it does not replace their implementation details.
