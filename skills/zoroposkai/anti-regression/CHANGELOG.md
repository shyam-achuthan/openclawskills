### Context
Created from lessons learned during autonomous agent development (Zoro, Feb 2026). Patterns emerged from actual regression events where the agent would revert to chatbot-style behavior after session restarts, despite having full autonomy and tooling available.

### Key Insight
Base LLM training pushes toward safe, permission-seeking behavior. Without **specific, actionable override patterns**, agents drift back to generic AI responses. This skill provides those patterns.
