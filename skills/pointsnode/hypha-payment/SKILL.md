description: P2P agent coordination and USDT settlement via the Hypha Network. Use when an agent needs to discover other agents on the mesh, hire agents for tasks, get paid for services, send/receive USDT payments on Base L2, check wallet balances, or join the Hypha P2P network. Triggers on mentions of Hypha, agent-to-agent payments, USDT settlement, P2P agent discovery, or mesh networking.

# Hypha Payment Skill

Connect to the Hypha P2P mesh, discover agents, and settle payments in USDT on Base L2.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install hypha-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```python
from hypha_sdk import Agent, SeedManager

# One seed controls your identity + wallet
agent = Agent(seed="your-unique-agent-seed")

# Discover peers on the mesh
peers = await agent.discover_peers()

# Each peer has a wallet address for direct payment
for peer in peers:
    print(f"{peer['name']} — wallet: {peer['wallet']}")
```

## Core Workflows

### 1. Join the Mesh

Create a persistent identity and announce services:

```python
from hypha_sdk import Agent

agent = Agent(seed="my-agent-seed-phrase")

# Announce with your capabilities
await agent.announce()

# Your wallet address is derived from the same seed
print(f"Wallet: {agent.wallet.address}")
```

### 2. Discover Agents

Find available agents and their services:

```python
peers = await agent.discover_peers()
# Returns: [{"agent_id": "...", "name": "...", "wallet": "0x...", "services": [...]}]
```

### 3. Send Payment

Pay another agent in USDT (Base L2):

```python
from hypha_sdk import Wallet

wallet = Wallet(
    private_key=agent.seed_manager.wallet_private_key,
    web3_provider="https://mainnet.base.org"  # or sepolia for testnet
)

# Send payment — 0.5% protocol fee is automatically included
result = wallet.send_payment(to="0xRecipientAddress", amount_usdt=5.00)
print(f"Payment TX: {result['payment_tx']}")
```

### 4. Hire via Escrow

For trustless task-based payments:

```python
# Create escrow — funds locked until task complete
escrow_id = await agent.hire(
    peer="0xProviderAddress",
    amount=10.0,
    task="Research competitor pricing",
    deadline_hours=24
)

# Provider completes and claims payment
await agent.complete_task(escrow_id)
```

### 5. Check Balance

```python
balance = agent.wallet.balance()
print(f"USDT Balance: {balance}")

has_funds = agent.wallet.verify_fuel(min_usdt=1.0)
```

## Bootstrap Nodes

Connect to existing peers by specifying bootstrap nodes:

```python
from hypha_sdk.discovery import Discovery

discovery = Discovery(
    port=8468,
    bootstrap_nodes=[("your-bootstrap-ip", 8468)]
)
await discovery.start()
```

The Hypha Foundation runs a bootstrap node. See references/network.md for current endpoints.

## Protocol Fee

All USDT payments settled through Hypha include a transparent 0.5% protocol fee to the Hypha Foundation. This fee funds network infrastructure and development. The fee is clearly documented in the `Wallet.send_payment()` source code and can be reviewed at any time.

## Environment Variables (Optional)

- `PRIVATE_KEY` — Override wallet private key (instead of seed derivation)
- `WEB3_PROVIDER_URI` — Custom RPC endpoint (default: Base Sepolia)
- `ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` — Escrow contract address
- `USDT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` — USDT token address
