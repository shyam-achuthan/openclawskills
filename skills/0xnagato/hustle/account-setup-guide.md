## Account Security Best Practices

### Password Management
- Use unique passwords for EVERY platform
- Recommended: 1Password, Bitwarden, or LastPass
- Enable 2FA on EVERYTHING
- Store backup codes in vault

### 2FA Methods (Priority Order)
1. **Best:** Hardware key (YubiKey)
2. **Good:** Authenticator app (Authy, Google Authenticator)
3. **Acceptable:** SMS (better than nothing)
4. **Never:** Email-only

### Operational Security
- **Separate Email:** Use dedicated email for hustle operations
- **VPN:** Consider for bot operations (prevents geo-blocking)
- **Separate Browser Profile:** Chrome/Firefox profile just for arbitrage
- **Regular Password Rotation:** Every 90 days for critical accounts

   */30 * * * * ~/.openclaw/cron/hustle-automation.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Heartbeat:**
   - Edit `hustle/HEARTBEAT.md` with your check preferences
   - Test: Run heartbeat manually once to verify

4. **Monitor for 24-48h:**
   - Watch logs: `tail -f hustle/logs/*.log`
   - Verify no errors
