## Prompt Writing Rules

These rules apply to every prompt sent to the genviral API:

1. **Include the exact hook text in slide 1.** Do not let the AI rephrase your hook. The hook is deliberate and tested.

2. **Set the tone explicitly.** Include a phrase like "casual, conversational, like talking to a friend" to prevent corporate-sounding output. Match `context/brand-voice.md`.

3. **Cap the word count.** Always include "Max 15 words per slide" or similar constraint.

4. **Be specific in the story arc.** The more detail you provide about each slide's purpose, the better the output.

5. **Match the prompt to the pack.** If using a nature/outdoor pack, lean into outdoor scenarios. If using a minimalist pack, lean into clean and simple text.

6. **Always review before rendering.** Check each slide's text before calling render. Fix weak slides with update or regenerate-slide.

7. **Never send placeholders to the API.** Every bracket must be replaced with real content before generating.

8. **No em-dashes.** Instruct the AI explicitly: "Do not use em-dashes."
