# Hook Brainstorming Prompts

These are prompts the agent uses to generate batches of new hooks. Each prompt is designed to produce 5 to 10 hooks at once for a specific formula category.

Before using any prompt:
1. Read `context/product.md` for the product, features, and audience.
2. Read `context/brand-voice.md` for the tone and style.
3. Read `hooks/formulas.md` for the formula patterns.
4. Read `performance/insights.md` for what has worked and what has not.

Replace ALL placeholders before using.
