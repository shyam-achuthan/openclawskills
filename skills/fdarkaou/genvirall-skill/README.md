# Genviral Skill

An [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill for the [Genviral](https://genviral.io) Partner API.

It generates slideshows, posts them across 6 platforms, tracks what performs, and adjusts its strategy based on real data. Every cycle makes the next one better.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Posting | Analytics | Notes |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **TikTok** | Yes | Yes | Slideshow carousels, videos. BYO or hosted accounts. |
| **Instagram** | Yes | Yes | Reels, stories, carousels, square/portrait/landscape posts. |
| **YouTube** | Yes | Yes | Shorts and standard video uploads. |
| **Facebook** | Yes | - | Posts, square posts, event covers. |
| **Pinterest** | Yes | - | Standard pins, square pins. |
| **LinkedIn** | Yes | - | Posts, square posts, company pages. |

Analytics (performance tracking, post metrics, account insights) is available for TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

## How It Works

The skill runs a closed loop:

1. **Generate** slideshows from a prompt + image pack
2. **Review** each slide visually before anything gets posted
3. **Post** to connected accounts across any supported platform
4. **Track** performance through analytics endpoints
5. **Learn** what hooks, formats, and timing actually work
6. **Adapt** strategy weights, retire underperformers, double down on winners

It keeps a performance log, distills insights, and rewrites its own strategy over time. The longer it runs, the better it gets.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set your API key
export GENVIRAL_API_KEY="your_public_id.your_secret"

# See what accounts you have
./scripts/genviral.sh accounts

# Generate a slideshow
./scripts/genviral.sh generate --prompt "5 morning habits that changed my life" --pack-id PACK_ID

# Render and post it
./scripts/genviral.sh render --id SLIDESHOW_ID
./scripts/genviral.sh create-post --caption "Caption here" --media-type slideshow --media-urls "url1,url2,..." --accounts ACCOUNT_ID

# Check how it performed
./scripts/genviral.sh analytics-summary --range 30d
```

## Installation

Clone into your OpenClaw skills directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/workspace/agent/skills
git clone https://github.com/fdarkaou/genviral-skill.git genviral
```

Requires: `bash` 4+, `curl`, `jq`, and a [Genviral](https://genviral.io) account with Partner API access.

## Automation

The skill includes cron job definitions to run the full pipeline on autopilot. See **[cron-setup.md](cron-setup.md)** for:

- Daily content generation (generate, render, review, post)
- Daily performance checks (pull analytics, log metrics)
- Weekly strategy reviews (analyze what worked, update hook weights, plan next week)

With cron set up, the agent runs the entire content pipeline without manual intervention.

## Commands

| Category | What |
|----------|------|
| **Accounts** | List connected accounts, upload files |
| **Slideshows** | Generate, render, review, update, regenerate slides, duplicate, delete |
| **Posts** | Create, update, retry failed, list, delete |
| **Packs** | CRUD for image packs + image management |
| **Templates** | CRUD for slideshow templates, convert from existing slideshows |
| **Analytics** | Summary stats, post metrics, target management, refresh tracking, workspace suggestions |

`genviral.sh help` for the full list.

## The Self-Improving Part

The skill doesn't just post content. It builds a feedback loop:

- **Hook formulas** have weights. High performers get used more, duds get retired.
- **Performance log** tracks every post with 24h/48h/7d metrics.
- **Weekly reviews** distill patterns into actionable insights.
- **Strategy adapts** automatically based on what the data says.

With analytics endpoints enabled, the loop closes entirely. Without them, the agent still tracks its own output and learns from manual feedback.
