# .agents.local.md — Local Agent Scratchpad

> Gitignored. Never committed. Persistent memory across agent sessions.

## Preferences

- **Style:** [e.g., Friendly, technical, peer-to-peer. No corporate jargon.]
- **Code:** [e.g., Minimal changes. No speculative refactors.]
- **Planning:** [e.g., Always state the plan before writing code.]

## Patterns

<!-- Settled truths about this project. Promote recurring session learnings here. -->

## Gotchas

<!-- Things that look right but aren't. Include WHY. -->

## Dead Ends

<!-- Approaches tried and failed. Include WHY they failed. -->

## Ready to Promote

<!-- The agent flags items here during compression when a pattern has recurred across 3+ sessions.
     The human decides when to move them into AGENTS.md's Project Knowledge section.
     Use the same pipe-delimited format AGENTS.md expects:
       pattern | where-to-see-it    → goes in Patterns
       rule | reason                → goes in Boundaries
       trap | fix                   → goes in Gotchas
-->

## Session Log

<!-- Append new entries at the END. One entry per session. Keep each to 5-10 lines. -->

### YYYY-MM-DD — Topic

- **Done:** (what changed)
- **Worked:** (reuse this)
- **Didn't work:** (avoid this)
- **Decided:** (choices and reasoning)
- **Learned:** (new patterns or gotchas)
