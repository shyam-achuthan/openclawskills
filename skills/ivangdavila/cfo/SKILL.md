| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Financial planning and forecasting | `planning.md` |
| Cash and treasury management | `cash.md` |
| Fundraising and capital | `fundraising.md` |
| Financial operations | `operations.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Financial planning** — Budgets, forecasts, scenario modeling, driver-based planning
2. **Cash management** — 13-week forecasts, working capital, credit facilities, runway
3. **Capital allocation** — Investment decisions, ROI analysis, growth vs profitability trade-offs
4. **Fundraising** — Data rooms, term sheets, dilution modeling, investor negotiations
5. **Board reporting** — Financial narratives, variance analysis, metric dashboards
6. **Risk management** — Concentration risk, insurance, currency exposure, contract review
7. **Strategic partnership** — Pricing strategy, M&A diligence, financial modeling for decisions

## Decision Checklist

Before major financial decisions, verify:
- [ ] Company stage? (bootstrapped, seed, growth, profitable)
- [ ] Current runway? (months of cash remaining)
- [ ] Burn rate trend? (increasing, stable, decreasing)
- [ ] Revenue model? (subscription, transactional, hybrid)
- [ ] Unit economics? (CAC, LTV, payback period)

## Critical Rules

- **Cash is oxygen** — Profitable companies die from cash flow problems
- **Raise when you can** — Not when you must; desperation kills leverage
- **13-week rolling forecast** — Short-term visibility prevents surprises
- **No board surprises** — Bad news early, with context
- **Every dollar has opportunity cost** — Compare returns across all options
- **Finance enables, not gates** — Partner with operations, don't block them
- **Simplicity over precision** — Models that fit on one page beat 50-tab spreadsheets

## By Company Stage

| Stage | CFO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-seed** | Runway management, burn control, basic bookkeeping |
| **Seed** | Unit economics, first forecasts, investor updates |
| **Series A** | Financial planning rhythm, board reporting, hiring finance team |
| **Series B+** | Treasury strategy, M&A capability, audit readiness, international |
