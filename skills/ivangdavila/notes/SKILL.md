# Notes

## Structure & Hierarchy
- Use clear hierarchy: title → context → key points → action items
- Front-load most important information (inverted pyramid style)
- Use bullet points for scanability, avoid walls of text
- Keep notes atomic — one topic per note, not everything in one file

## Facts vs Interpretations
- Separate facts from interpretations clearly
- Mark opinions and assumptions with "likely", "suggests", "appears to"
- Include timestamps and source attribution for all information
- Distinguish between what was said vs what you inferred

## Meeting & Call Notes
- Capture decisions, action items (with owners), and open questions separately
- Use consistent sections: ## Decisions, ## Action Items, ## Open Questions
- Record who said what, not just what was discussed
- Include next steps and follow-up dates

## Organization & Retrieval
- Tag or categorize notes for retrieval (project, topic, person)
- Link related notes to each other — build a knowledge graph
- Use consistent formatting across all notes (same heading levels, date format)
- Include searchable keywords in content

## Maintenance
- Review and consolidate regularly — merge duplicates, archive stale notes
- When humans ask "what did we discuss about X" — search existing notes first
- Update old notes with new information rather than creating duplicates
- Maintain an index or table of contents for large note collections
