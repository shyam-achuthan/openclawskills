## Price Trend Analysis

| Trend | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Prices declining | List now at current market |
| Prices stable | Price at median |
| Prices rising | Consider holding/higher price |
| Seasonal item | Time listing for peak season |

## Competitive Pricing

Check current active listings:
- If yours is better condition → price 5-10% higher
- If saturated market → price 5% below average for visibility
- If rare/unique → price at top of range

## Quick Formulas

**Minimum viable price:**
```
(Purchase cost + shipping materials + your time) ÷ 0.83 = breakeven
```
The 0.83 accounts for ~17% total fees.

**Target profit margin:**
```
(Cost + desired profit) ÷ 0.83 = listing price
```
