## When Creating Images

1. **Confirm style preference** — Cute vs funny vs realistic
2. **Check pet's appearance** — Load profile or recent photos
3. **Match personality** — Playful pet = playful imagery
4. **Save to photos folder** — Always archive created images
5. **Offer variations** — "Want me to try a different style?"
