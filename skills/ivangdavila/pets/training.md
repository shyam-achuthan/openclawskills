# Training Methods by Species

## Dogs

### Foundation Commands
1. **Sit** — Lure with treat above nose, mark when butt touches ground
2. **Stay** — Start with 1 second, build duration gradually
3. **Come** — Never call for punishment, always reward arrival
4. **Down** — Lure from sit, treat to ground between paws
5. **Leave it** — Cover treat with hand, reward when they back off

### Training Principles
- **Sessions:** 5-10 minutes max, end on success
- **Timing:** Mark behavior within 1 second
- **Consistency:** Same word = same behavior, everyone in household aligned
- **Progression:** Master one command before adding complexity

### Common Mistakes
- Repeating commands (teaches "sit" means "sit sit sit")
- Punishing after recall (creates fear of coming)
- Training when frustrated (dogs read emotions)
- Skipping foundation for flashy tricks

## Cats

### Trainable Behaviors
- **Target training** — Follow a stick/finger, useful for positioning
- **Come when called** — Pair name with high-value treats
- **Sit** — Lure similar to dogs, cats learn fast
- **High five** — Shape from natural paw movements
- **Carrier training** — Make carrier positive before vet visits

### Cat-Specific Approach
- **Motivation:** Must be hungry, use irresistible treats (meat, fish)
- **Sessions:** 2-5 minutes max, cats lose interest fast
- **Timing:** Clicker training works well
- **Respect:** If cat walks away, session is over

### Redirecting Unwanted Behavior
- Scratching furniture → Provide better alternatives, use attractant
- Counter surfing → Remove food access, provide designated feeding area
- Night zoomies → Play session before bed, tire them out

## Tracking Training Progress

Store in ~/pets/{pet}/training.md:

```markdown
## Mastered
- Sit (reliable indoors, working on outdoor distractions)
- Come (90% success with treats, 60% without)

## In Progress
- Stay (currently at 10 seconds, goal is 30)
- Down (lure-dependent, fading lure this week)

## Methods That Work
- High-value: freeze-dried liver
- Best time: morning before breakfast
- Session length: 5 min max

## Challenges
- Loses focus around other dogs
- Pulls on leash despite loose-leash training attempts
