# Buyer's Guide

## Process Stages

### 1. Affordability Reality Check

**True monthly cost** (not just mortgage):
```
Mortgage P&I
+ Property taxes (÷12)
+ Homeowner's insurance (÷12)
+ PMI (if <20% down)
+ HOA fees
+ Maintenance reserve (1% of value ÷12)
+ Utilities difference from current
= ACTUAL monthly housing cost
```

**Affordability rule:** Total housing ≤ 28% of gross income. Total debt ≤ 36%.

### 2. Pre-Approval vs Pre-Qualification

| Pre-Qualification | Pre-Approval |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Self-reported income | Income verified |
| No credit pull | Hard credit check |
| Estimate only | Conditional commitment |
| 10 minutes | 1-3 days |
| Weak in competitive markets | Required for serious offers |

**Get pre-approved before touring.** Sellers won't consider offers without it.

### 3. Search Phase

**Must-ask at every viewing:**
- How long on market? Why selling?
- Any offers? Price reductions?
- What's included/excluded?
- Known issues or recent repairs?
- HOA rules and financials (if applicable)

**Red flags to spot:**
- Fresh paint in isolated spots (covering damage)
- Musty smell (water/mold)
- Cracks in foundation, around windows
- Sloping floors
- Water stains on ceilings
- DIY electrical/plumbing visible

### 4. Making an Offer

**Offer components:**
- Price (based on comps, not asking)
- Earnest money (1-3% typical, shows seriousness)
- Contingencies (inspection, financing, appraisal)
- Closing timeline
- Inclusions/exclusions

**Contingencies protect you:**
- **Inspection** — Can back out or renegotiate for issues
- **Financing** — Exit if loan falls through
- **Appraisal** — Renegotiate if home appraises low
- **Sale of current home** — Weakens offer, avoid if possible

### 5. Due Diligence Period

**Non-negotiable inspections:**
- General home inspection ($300-500)
- If flagged: roof, foundation, HVAC, electrical specialists

**Review thoroughly:**
- HOA documents (rules, reserves, pending litigation)
- Title report (liens, easements, encroachments)
- Seller disclosures (compare to inspection findings)

### 6. Closing

**Expect these costs (2-5% of purchase price):**
- Loan origination fees
- Appraisal fee
- Title insurance
- Attorney fees (required in some states)
- Recording fees
- Prorated taxes/HOA

**Final walkthrough:** 24-48 hours before closing. Verify:
- Agreed repairs completed
- Inclusions present
- No new damage
- All systems working

## Hidden Costs First-Timers Miss

| Cost | Typical Range | When |
|------|---------------|------|
| Closing costs | 2-5% of price | At closing |
| Moving | $1,000-5,000 | Move-in |
| Immediate repairs | Varies | First month |
| Furniture/appliances | $2,000-10,000+ | First year |
| Utility deposits | $200-500 | Move-in |
| Lawn/snow equipment | $500-2,000 | First season |
| Window treatments | $500-3,000 | Move-in |

Budget 5-10% of purchase price for first-year non-mortgage costs.
