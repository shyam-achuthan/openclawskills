## Investor Updates

**Monthly cadence, even when hard.** Silence destroys trust.

**Template:**
1. **One-liner** — Company state in one sentence
2. **Key metrics** — 3-5 numbers that matter, with trend
3. **Wins** — What went well
4. **Challenges** — What's hard (be honest)
5. **Asks** — Intros, advice, resources needed
6. **Upcoming** — What to watch next month

## Difficult Board Conversations

### Cash is Running Low
- Present problem early, not when desperate
- Show scenarios (cut X, runway becomes Y)
- Propose specific plan
- Ask for bridge terms if needed

### Missing Plan
- Own it, don't make excuses
- Show root cause analysis
- Present recovery plan with milestones
- Rebuild trust through execution

### Need to Pivot
- Frame as learning, not failure
- Show data that drove the decision
- Present new direction with conviction
- Request endorsement and support
