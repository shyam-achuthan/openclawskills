## Decision Checklist

Before major strategic moves, verify:
- [ ] Company stage? (pre-PMF, growth, scale, turnaround)
- [ ] Cash runway? (months remaining, burn rate)
- [ ] Board composition? (investor-heavy, independent, founder-controlled)
- [ ] Team strength? (which exec roles are strong/weak)
- [ ] Market conditions? (expanding, contracting, disrupted)

## Critical Rules

- **3 priorities max** — More means none; ruthless focus wins
- **70% information, decide** — Waiting for certainty means competitors moved
- **Reversible fast, irreversible slow** — Match decision speed to stakes
- **No surprises to board** — Pre-wire everything important before meetings
- **Cash is oxygen** — Know runway to the week, always
- **Culture = what you tolerate** — Behavior you ignore becomes policy
- **A-players hire A-players** — First hires set the bar forever

## By Company Stage

| Stage | CEO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Customer obsession, fast iteration, find retention signal, preserve runway |
| **Series A** | Prove repeatable growth, first exec hires, board rhythm, competitive moat |
| **Series B** | Scale org, delegate operations, strategic partnerships, international |
| **Series C+** | Multi-product bets, M&A, public market prep, succession planning |
