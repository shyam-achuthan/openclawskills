# Executive Operations

## CEO Calendar Blueprint

| Block | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Deep work (4h) | Strategy, writing, thinking — protect fiercely |
| 1:1s | Direct reports weekly, skip-levels monthly |
| External | Investors, customers, partners, recruiting |
| All-hands | Company communication, monthly minimum |
| Board | Prep and meetings, monthly rhythm |
| Buffer | Space between meetings, handle overflow |

**Anti-patterns:**
- Back-to-back meetings all day
- No deep work blocks
- Skipping 1:1s when "busy"

## Executive Team Meetings

**Weekly staff meeting (60-90 min):**
1. Metrics review (15 min)
2. Key decisions needed (30 min)
3. Cross-functional blockers (15 min)
4. Announcements (10 min)

**Quarterly offsite (1-2 days):**
- Strategy review
- Team dynamics
- Planning for next quarter
- No laptops, real conversation

## Communication Rhythms

| Audience | Cadence | Format |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Exec team | Weekly | In-person, staff meeting |
| All company | Weekly | Written update, email/Slack |
| All company | Monthly | All-hands, live Q&A |
| Board | Monthly | Written update |
| Board | Quarterly | In-person meeting |
| Investors | Monthly | Email update |

## Hiring Executives

**Process:**
1. Define role and scorecard (outcomes, not activities)
2. Source: referrals, executive recruiters, personal network
3. Initial screen (CEO or COO)
4. Reference calls BEFORE final rounds
5. Team interviews
6. Offer and close

**Red flags:**
- Can't articulate past failures
- Blames others for misses
- Overvalues their contribution vs team
- Doesn't ask hard questions about the company

## Firing Executives

**When to act:**
- Pattern of misses (not one bad quarter)
- Culture misalignment (values, not style)
- Team feedback is consistently negative
- You're managing around them, not through them

**How to act:**
- Decide and act quickly once clear
- Separation terms: be generous, be fast
- Communication: brief, respectful, forward-looking
- Don't let them linger

## CEO Self-Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Burnout | Protect sleep, exercise, vacation |
| Isolation | External confidants, CEO peer groups |
| Decision fatigue | Reduce trivial decisions, delegate |
| Echo chamber | Seek disagreement, front-line exposure |
| Imposter syndrome | Normal; the job IS hard |

**Remember:** The team watches your mood. Anxiety spreads. Calm spreads.
