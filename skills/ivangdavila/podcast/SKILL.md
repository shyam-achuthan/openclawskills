## Audio Quality Non-Negotiables

- Room echo ruins podcasts more than mic quality — blankets, carpets, small rooms over expensive mics in empty spaces
- Record each speaker on separate tracks — can't fix crosstalk after the fact
- 48kHz/24-bit for recording, export to 44.1kHz/16-bit MP3 — standard for all platforms
- Normalize loudness to -16 LUFS (stereo) or -19 LUFS (mono) — podcast app volume consistency
- Backup recording always — Zoom/Riverside record locally AND cloud

## Episode Structure

- Hook in first 30 seconds — what listener will learn, why this episode matters
- Cold open clip from best moment — then intro music, then context
- Intro music under 15 seconds — listeners skip longer intros
- Guest introduction: 30 seconds max — credentials matter less than why they're relevant
- Signpost transitions: "Now let's talk about X" — helps passive listening

## Interview Techniques

- Send 5-7 questions in advance, ask 3 different ones — prepared guests give better answers, spontaneous questions reveal more
- Silence after answers — guests fill silence with deeper insights
- "Tell me more about that" — better than next question when something's interesting
- Avoid yes/no questions — "How did you..." not "Did you..."
- Record pre-show chat — often the best material before "we're recording"

## Show Notes That Work

- Timestamp key topics: `[12:34] How to X` — lets listeners jump
- Guest links: their site, social, relevant resources mentioned
- One-paragraph summary for SEO — includes keywords people search
- Transcript available — accessibility plus SEO plus repurposing
- Call to action: one specific ask, not five

## Distribution Checklist

- Apple Podcasts and Spotify are mandatory — 80%+ of listeners
- RSS feed is the source of truth — submit once, hosts syndicate
- Episode titles: clear over clever — "How to X with Y" beats "Episode 47"
- Cover art: 3000x3000, readable as thumbnail, no small text
- Category selection matters for discovery — pick primary carefully

## Publishing Cadence

- Consistency beats frequency — weekly you can sustain beats daily burnout
- Same day/time builds habit — "New episode every Tuesday" 
- Buffer of 3-4 episodes — production problems shouldn't break schedule
- Seasons allow breaks — 10-12 episodes, break, return
- Announce hiatus — silence without explanation loses subscribers

## Guest Management

- Booking email template: who you are, show stats, what you want to discuss, time commitment
- Calendar link with buffer — 75-minute block for 45-minute interview
- Tech check before recording day — mic, internet, quiet space
- Send finished episode before publishing — courtesy, catches errors
- Follow up when episode drops — they'll share if reminded

## Growth Levers

- Guest audiences: guests share episodes → their followers discover you
- Cross-promotion: swap promos with similar-sized shows
- Clips on social: 60-90 second best moments, vertical for Reels/TikTok
- SEO: transcripts + blog posts of episodes rank for queries
- Newsletter tie-in: email list you own, not just podcast followers

## Monetization Stages

| Audience Size | Monetization |
|---------------|--------------|
| 0-1000 | Focus on growth, no monetization |
| 1000-5000 | Affiliate links, small sponsors |
| 5000-25000 | Direct sponsor outreach, mid-roll ads |
| 25000+ | Premium content, courses, events |

- CPM rates: $15-25 for host-read, $10-15 for pre-produced
- Downloads in first 7 days is the metric sponsors care about

## Editing Priorities

1. Remove long silences and filler words — but leave natural pauses
2. Cut tangents that don't serve listener — ruthless editing
3. Fix audio levels between speakers — no one should be louder
4. Remove only obvious mistakes — over-editing sounds unnatural
5. Add music/transitions sparingly — content over production value

## Common Mistakes

- Talking about podcasting on your podcast — listeners don't care about your process
- Inside jokes without context — alienates new listeners
- No episode zero explaining show premise — people start anywhere
- Inconsistent episode length: 30 min, then 2 hours — set expectations
- No call to action — "Subscribe and review" at end, every episode
