CRON JOB FIX NOTES
==================

Problem: Cron jobs failing because delivery target defaults to @heartbeat
Solution: Need to run them manually or use clawdbot CLI with explicit --to flag

WORKAROUND - Manual Script Approach:

I will create shell scripts and use macOS launchd instead of unreliable cron tool.

Created jobs to run via launchd:
1. /Users/ericwoodard/clawd/cron/daily-claude-code.sh - 7:00 AM
2. /Users/ericwoodard/clawd/cron/daily-mail-hygiene.sh - 10:10 AM  
3. /Users/ericwoodard/clawd/cron/daily-briefing.sh - 10:15 AM

Each script will use 'clawdbot agent --to telegram:-1003892992445' to send results directly to MOLT3D group.

This bypasses the broken cron delivery entirely.
