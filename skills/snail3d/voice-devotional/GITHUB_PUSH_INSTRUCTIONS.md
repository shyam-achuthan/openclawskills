## Steps to Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new (or https://github.com/Snail3D/repositories/new if you already own the account)
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `voice-devotional`
   - **Owner:** `Snail3D`
   - **Description:** "Generate scripture readings and lessons in audio using ElevenLabs TTS"
   - **Public or Private:** Your choice
3. **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check "Initialize this repository with:"
   - We already have README, .gitignore, and don't need a license file yet
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Authentication

Choose ONE method:

#### Option A: HTTPS with Personal Access Token (Recommended)
```bash
# You'll be prompted for username and token when pushing
# Create a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Requires: repo scope at minimum
```

#### Option B: SSH (More secure)
```bash
# Setup SSH key if not already done
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Add public key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### Step 3: Push the Code

```bash
cd ~/clawd/skills/voice-devotional

# Add remote (should already be configured, but verify)
git remote -v
# Should show: origin  https://github.com/Snail3D/voice-devotional.git

# If remote doesn't exist, add it:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/Snail3D/voice-devotional.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Success

After pushing, check:
1. Open https://github.com/Snail3D/voice-devotional
2. Verify all 20 files are there
3. Check commit history shows both commits
4. View README.md renders correctly

## If You Get an Error

### "repository not found"
- Verify repository was created on GitHub
- Check the owner is correct (Snail3D)
- Make sure you're authenticated properly

### "Permission denied (publickey)"
- Set up SSH key: `ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`
- Or use HTTPS with personal access token

### "fatal: not a git repository"
- Make sure you're in: `cd ~/clawd/skills/voice-devotional`

## Quick Push Command (One-Liner)

If everything is set up:
```bash
cd ~/clawd/skills/voice-devotional && git push -u origin main
```

## Optional: Create a GitHub Release

After pushing, you can create a release tag:

```bash
cd ~/clawd/skills/voice-devotional

# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release - voice-devotional v1.0.0

- ElevenLabs TTS integration
- Daily devotionals and scripture readings
- Multi-day reading plans
- Full CLI interface

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0.0
