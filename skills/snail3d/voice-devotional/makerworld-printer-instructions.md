## 2. How to Use the Skill Step-by-Step

### Basic Workflow:

1. **Start a search**
   - Say: "Search Makerworld for [model name]"
   - Example: "Search Makerworld for phone stand"
   - Example: "Search Makerworld for articulated dragon"

2. **Browse results**
   - Review the top matches with model names and descriptions
   - Ask to see more results if needed: "Show me more results"

3. **Select a model**
   - Specify the model you want: "I want the first one"
   - Or: "Get the one by [designer name]"

4. **Choose printer (if you have multiple)**
   - Specify your printer: "Use my A1 mini"
   - Or: "Print on the X1C"

5. **Select print profile**
   - Choose quality level: "Draft", "Normal", "Fine", or "Super Fine"
   - Example: "Use the Fine profile"

6. **Configure colors (for multi-material printers)**
   - Specify colors for each part: "Use red for the base and blue for the top"
   - Available colors depend on your loaded filaments

7. **Start printing**
   - Confirm: "Start the print"
   - The skill will upload the model to your Bambu Lab Cloud and send to printer

## 4. Selecting the Right Print Profile

### Print Profile Comparison:

| Profile | Layer Height | Print Speed | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Draft** | 0.28mm | Fast | Prototypes, quick tests |
| **Normal** | 0.20mm | Medium | Everyday prints |
| **Fine** | 0.12mm | Slow | High-quality display pieces |
| **Super Fine** | 0.08mm | Very Slow | Miniature, detailed art |

### When to use each:

**Use Draft when:**
- Testing a new design
- Printing functional parts that don't need aesthetics
- Quick turnaround needed
- Material is expensive and you want to save

**Use Normal when:**
- Standard quality is sufficient
- Balance between speed and quality
- Most functional prints
- Everyday objects

**Use Fine when:**
- Displaying the print
- Visible surfaces matter
- Better detail on curves and overhangs
- Gifting or selling the print

**Use Super Fine when:**
- Miniature figures
- Highly detailed sculptures
- No post-processing allowed
- Maximum quality required

## 5. Choosing Filament Colors

### Single Extruder Printers (A1 mini, A1)
- **One color per print**
- Specify color when starting: "Print in blue PLA"
- Common colors: Black, White, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Grey

### Multi-Material Printers with AMS (P1S, X1C, X1E)

#### Color Selection Commands:
- "Use [color 1] for [part description], [color 2] for [part description]"
- Example: "Use black for the body and orange for the eyes"

#### Supported Colors:
Standard Bambu Lab colors:
- Black, White, Grey (Light, Medium, Dark)
- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink
- Glow-in-the-dark Green/Blue
- Silk variants (gold, silver, bronze)

#### Automatic Color Assignment:
- The skill will try to match part colors in the 3D model to your available filaments
- Specify "automatic colors" to let the skill choose best matches
- You'll be asked to confirm before printing

#### Tips:
- Load 4 different colors in AMS for maximum flexibility
- Use similar material types (don't mix PLA and ABS in same print)
- Always verify filament types match your settings

## 6. Complete Workflow from Search to Print

### Step-by-Step Example:

**User:** "Search Makerworld for articulated fidget cube"

**Assistant:** *[Shows 5 results with descriptions]*
1. Articulated Fidget Cube by DesignerA - 12 parts, no support needed
2. Infinity Fidget Cube by DesignerB - 8 parts, moderate supports
3. ...

**User:** "Get the first one"

**Assistant:** "Great! The Articulated Fidget Cube has 12 separate parts. Which printer would you like to use?"

**User:** "My X1C"

**Assistant:** "Perfect! Your X1C supports multi-material printing. What print profile would you like?"

**User:** "Fine quality"

**Assistant:** "Fine profile selected (0.12mm layer height). The model has 12 parts. Would you like to:
- Use automatic color matching
- Manually specify colors
- Print everything in one color"

**User:** "Automatic colors"

**Assistant:** "Based on your loaded filaments, I suggest:
- Parts 1-8: White PLA
- Parts 9-12: Black PLA
Estimated print time: 3h 45m
Total filament: 85g

Would you like to start the print?"

**User:** "Yes, start printing"

## 7. Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Search Issues:
- **No results found:** Try different keywords, more generic terms, or check spelling
- **Too many results:** Add specific details like "miniature", "functional", "articulated"

### Print Profile Issues:
- **Profile not available:** Some profiles may not be compatible with all materials or models
- **Print too slow:** Switch to Draft profile for faster prints
- **Print too rough:** Switch to Fine or Super Fine for better quality

### Color Issues:
- **Color not available:** Check which filaments are loaded in your AMS/printer
- **Wrong color assigned:** You can specify "part 3 in blue" to override automatic assignments
- **Mixed materials error:** Ensure all filaments in AMS are same type (all PLA or all PETG)

### Printer Connection Issues:
- **Printer offline:** Check your printer's network connection
- **Cloud sync error:** Verify Bambu Lab credentials and internet connection
- **Print failed to start:** Check printer bed is clean and filament is loaded

### Print Quality Issues:
- **Stringing:** Enable retraction settings or lower print temperature
- **Layer shifting:** Check belt tension and printer stability
- **Poor adhesion:** Clean bed with isopropyl alcohol, increase bed temperature
- **Supports difficult:** Try different support patterns or enable tree supports

### General Tips:
- Always preview the 3D model before printing
- Check model comments for printing tips from the designer
- Start with a test print if you're unsure about settings
- Keep firmware updated on your printer
- Use the Bambu Handy app to monitor prints remotely
