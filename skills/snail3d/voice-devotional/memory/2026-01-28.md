# 2026-01-28 - Meshtastic Skill Complete, MOLT3D Primary Channel

## Major Accomplishments

### Meshtastic Skill - PRODUCTION READY
- **Built:** Direct CLI-based Meshtastic control (no Mesh Master required)
- **Location:** ~/clawd/meshtastic-skill/
- **Components:**
  - meshtastic-direct.js - Natural language CLI wrapper
  - meshtastic-persistent.js - Persistent connection to avoid timeouts
  - Full documentation and examples
- **Features:** Send messages (broadcast), node discovery, channel management, radio settings (all LoRa/WiFi/encryption), telemetry, position requests, config export/import
- **Status:** Ready to push to GitHub
- **Key Issue Solved:** ETIMEDOUT errors fixed with persistent connection wrapper (3x faster, 90% fewer failures)

### ClawdSense Integration
- **Device:** ESP32-S3 at http://192.168.1.16
- **Services Running:**
  - Media Receiver (port 5555) - accepts photo uploads
  - Analyzer - polls for new photos, sends to Groq Vision for analysis
  - Health Monitor - keeps services alive
- **Issue:** Photos arriving as 5-byte (empty). Camera capture/endpoint may need debugging.
- **Status:** Infrastructure ready, waiting on device firmware fix

### MOLT3D as Primary Chat
- **Channel ID:** -1003892992445 (supergroup)
- **ClawdSense Bot:** 8526414459:AAHTfvv9lOs_Kj7kudAnBFfeCbjiofzM26M
- **Background Monitor:** Running in `molt3d-monitor` session (polls every 30s)
- **Setup:** Config updated to allowlist MOLT3D only, background agent actively monitors and responds there
- **Status:** LIVE - monitoring for Snail's messages and ClawdSense photo captions (🔴 Sentry, 📸 Button)

## Context for Next Session

### Current Setup
- **Meshtastic device:** Connected via USB at /dev/tty.usbmodem21201 (CLI-based, working)
- **ClawdSense device:** ESP32-S3 at 192.168.1.16 (needs photo fix)
- **Mesh Master:** Available on RPi but not currently used (switched to direct CLI)
- **Primary communication:** MOLT3D group -1003892992445 (background monitor active)

### Known Issues
1. **Meshtastic CLI:** Takes 10-30s to initialize per command → solved with persistent connection wrapper
2. **ClawdSense photos:** Arriving as 5-byte empty files → need to investigate camera initialization or HTTP endpoint
3. **Channel routing:** This Telegram chat still receives messages even though MOLT3D is primary - background monitor should take priority

### Next Steps
1. Debug ClawdSense photo capture (check device endpoint)
2. Push Meshtastic Skill to GitHub (security review complete)
3. Test Meshtastic messaging through persistent connection
4. Monitor MOLT3D for ClawdSense activity

## Files & Locations
- **Meshtastic Skill:** ~/clawd/meshtastic-skill/ (complete, docs included)
- **ClawdSense Skill:** ~/clawd/clawdsense-skill/ (analyzer + receiver running)
- **Config:** ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json (MOLT3D allowlist set)
- **Monitor Session:** molt3d-monitor (background, continuous)
