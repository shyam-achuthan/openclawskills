## Office Cam Skill - Complete Multi-Camera System Built

### What Was Built
**office-cam skill** - Full camera monitoring system supporting:

1. **USB Webcam (Logitech)** - ✅ Working
   - Instant capture via `capture.sh`
   - Motion detection via `motion-detect.sh`
   - **Overwatch mode** - 24/7 AI monitoring with alerts

2. **Wyze PTZ/v3** - ⚠️ Ready (needs network config)
   - RTSP integration scripts
   - `wyze-dashboard` for multi-cam management
   - `wyze-capture` for quick captures
   - Has RTSP URL but camera offline/asleep during testing

3. **ESP32-CAM** - ❌ Hardware works, wireless not cooperating
   - ESP-NOW base station firmware
   - ESP-NOW camera transmitter firmware  
   - Auto-discovery attempted
   - Boards detected each other but no photos transmitted
   - Likely firmware/ESP-NOW stack issue

### Files Created/Updated
- `~/clawd/skills/office-cam/SKILL.md` - Complete documentation
- `scripts/capture.sh` - USB webcam capture
- `scripts/motion-detect.sh` - Motion detection
- `scripts/overwatch` / `overwatch.py` - **24/7 AI monitoring**
- `scripts/wyze-capture` - Wyze quick capture
- `scripts/wyze-dashboard` - Wyze multi-cam manager
- `scripts/discover-wyze.sh` - Network discovery
- `firmware/espnow-base/` - ESP32 receiver
- `firmware/espnow-cam-auto/` - ESP32-CAM transmitter with auto-discovery
- Multiple ESP32 firmware variants tested

### Key Lessons
- Logitech USB webcams = bulletproof reliable
- Wyze RTSP works but needs camera awake/active
- ESP32-CAM ESP-NOW = promising but needs more debugging
- Motion detection with simple file size comparison works
- Overwatch mode = exactly what user wanted (AI monitoring with alerts)

### Next Steps (for user)
1. Test overwatch mode: `overwatch start`
2. Order more Logitech C920s for whole-house coverage
3. Fix Wyze network issue (check IP, wake camera)
4. Debug ESP32-CAM wireless (or use as wired USB cameras)

### Commands That Work NOW
```bash
# USB Webcam
cd ~/clawd/skills/office-cam
./scripts/capture.sh                    # Instant photo
./scripts/motion-detect.sh              # Motion detection
./scripts/overwatch start               # 24/7 monitoring

# Wyze (when camera is awake)
./scripts/wyze-dashboard add            # Add camera
./scripts/wyze-dashboard capture shed   # Capture
```

## Other Context
- User wants whole-house camera coverage
- ESP32-CAM hardware confirmed working but wireless stack issues
- Wyze PTZ has RTSP enabled: `rtsps://192.168.1.219:322/stream0`
- User's WiFi network: SpectrumSetup-617D
- Wyze credentials: Snail boy / HairyPickle26!
