## Conversation Summary

assistant: Let me approve that pairing for you.
assistant: I don't have direct access to the `clawdbot` CLI from here. You'll need to run that command on your machine where Clawdbot is installed.

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
clawdbot pairing approve telegram DFX9ECMV
```

Once you do that, your Telegram account will be linked to Clawdbot and you can chat with me there. Same conversation, just in Telegram. 📱

Let me know once you've run it!

assistant: The `clawdbot` CLI isn't installed on this computer yet. You have two options:

**Option 1: Install Clawdbot CLI on this computer**
Then run the pairing command from here.

**Option 2: Use webchat directly**
If the webchat interface is accessible from this computer, you can just open it in your browser and chat there — no CLI needed.

**Option 3: Run the command on the Mac mini**
Go back to your Mac mini (the one running the Gateway) and run the pairing command there.

Which one works for you? If you want to install the CLI on this machine, I can help guide you through it. Otherwise, what's the webchat URL you usually use?

assistant: Here's how to install Clawdbot CLI on this computer:

**Step 1: Check if you have Node.js installed**
```bash
node -v
```

You need Node 22 or newer. If you don't have it or have an older version, install the latest from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

**Step 2: Run the installer**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
```

This will install the CLI globally and run onboarding.

**Step 3: Run the pairing command**
Once installed, approve your Telegram pairing:
```bash
clawdbot pairing approve telegram DFX9ECMV
```

---

If the installer says you're missing build tools, you already ran `xcode-select --install`, so you should be good once that finishes installing. Just run the installer again after the Xcode Command Line Tools are done.

What version of Node do you have installed?
