# Scripture-Curated

> "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." — Psalm 119:105

**Connect God's Word to your world.** Scripture-Curated searches current events—global and personal—and finds relevant Scripture with theological depth, historical context, and reading plans that draw you into the biblical narrative.

## What It Does

### Daily Verse from the News

Every day, the skill searches current events and finds a Scripture that speaks to what's happening:

> **World Event**: Conflict escalating in the Middle East  
> **Scripture**: Isaiah 2:4 — "They shall beat their swords into plowshares..."  
> **Why**: The prophet envisions disarmament—war is not God's final plan

### Reading Plans That Connect

Not random verses—thematic journeys:

**7-Day Peace Plan:**
- Day 1: Romans 5:1 — Peace with God
- Day 2: John 14:27 — Christ's legacy  
- Day 3: Philippians 4:6-7 — Peace that guards
- Day 4: Isaiah 26:3 — Perfect peace
- Day 5: Psalm 46:10 — Be still
- Day 6: Matthew 5:9 — Peacemakers
- Day 7: Revelation 21:4 — No more tears

### Context You Can Trust

Every verse includes:
- **Historical context** — When was this written? To whom?
- **Theological significance** — What does this mean?
- **Practical application** — How do I live this?
- **Canonical connections** — What else does Scripture say?

## Theological Foundation

**Nicene Christianity** — The skill operates within historic Christian orthodoxy:

- Trinity: Father, Son, Holy Spirit—one God
- Christ: Fully God, fully man; crucified; risen; returning
- Scripture: Authoritative, inspired, sufficient
- Salvation: By grace through faith in Christ alone
- Church: One, holy, catholic, apostolic

See `config/nicene-creed.md` for the full framework.

## How It Works

### 1. News Search

- Significant trends

### 2. Scripture Matching

Maps events to themes:
- Conflict → Peace, Hope, Suffering
- Economic crisis → Faith, Wisdom, Trust
- Natural disaster → Refuge, Hope, New Creation
- Political → Wisdom, Justice, Kingdom

### 3. Context Generation

For each match, provides:
- **Connection**: Why this verse fits

## Examples

### War Breaking Out

**Input**: "Russia Ukraine conflict escalation"

**Output**:
> **Isaiah 2:4** — "They shall beat their swords into plowshares..."
>
> **Connection**: War is not God's final plan. The prophet envisions disarmament.
>
> **Context**: Isaiah writes during Assyrian threat, offering hope that empires fall but God's kingdom stands.
>
> **Application**: Pray for peace. Resist glorifying conflict. Christ's kingdom advances through love, not force.
>
> **Plan**: Isaiah 2 → Matthew 5:9 → Revelation 21:4

### Economic Anxiety

**Input**: "Recession fears, job loss concerns"

**Output**:
> **Matthew 6:19-21** — "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth..."
>
> **Connection**: Markets crash; treasure in heaven doesn't.
>
> **Context**: Jesus speaks to peasants under Roman occupation. Earthly treasure can be seized; heavenly treasure is secure.
>
> **Application**: Check your security—is it in your portfolio or God's provision? Give generously.

### Personal Loss

**Input**: "Dealing with grief, lost a loved one"

**Output**:
> **1 Thessalonians 4:13-14** — "We do not grieve as those who have no hope..."
>
> **Connection**: Christians grieve, but not without hope.
>
> **Context**: Paul comforts believers about deceased loved ones. The resurrection changes death's sting.
>
> **Application**: Grieve fully. Hope boldly. Christ's resurrection guarantees ours.

## Why This Exists

In a world of endless news and constant anxiety, Scripture offers:
- **Perspective**: God's view on human events
- **Hope**: Not naive optimism, but grounded eschatology
- **Wisdom**: How to live faithfully in difficult times
- **Peace**: Christ's peace, not the world's

This skill doesn't replace Bible reading—it curates entry points. The goal is always to send you deeper into Scripture, not to be a substitute.

## Theological Notes

### How We Interpret

1. **Christocentric**: All Scripture points to Christ
2. **Contextual**: Verses in literary and historical context
3. **Canonical**: Whole Bible interprets individual verses
4. **Traditional**: Historic Christian interpretation matters
5. **Doctrinal**: Scripture doesn't contradict itself
6. **Devotional**: Scripture transforms, not merely informs

### What We Avoid

- Proof-texting (verses out of context)
- Speculative interpretations
- Novel teachings without historic precedent
- Political co-option (partisan use of Scripture)
- Psychological reduction ("it's all about feelings")

## Limitations

- News search requires internet and API access
- Scripture matching is algorithmic, not infallible
- Personal context requires recent conversation
- Always points to Scripture as authoritative, not the skill's selections
