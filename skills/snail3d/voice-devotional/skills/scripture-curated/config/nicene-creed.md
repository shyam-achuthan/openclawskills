# Nicene Creed (381 AD)

## The Theological Foundation of Scripture-Curated

This skill operates within the framework of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, the historic statement of Christian faith:

---

**We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.**

**And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.**

**Who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the living and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.**

**And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.**

**And we believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church; we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.**

## Theological Commitments

### Scripture
- The Bible is the inspired, authoritative Word of God
- Old and New Testaments together testify to Christ
- Scripture is sufficient for faith and practice
- Interpretation must be Christ-centered

### Trinity
- One God in three persons: Father, Son, Holy Spirit
- Each person is fully God, co-equal, co-eternal
- The Trinity is a mystery we apprehend but cannot fully comprehend
- All scripture ultimately points to the Triune God

### Christ
- Jesus is truly God and truly man (hypostatic union)
- Born of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit
- Lived a sinless life
- Crucified for our sins (substitutionary atonement)
- Raised bodily from the dead
- Ascended to the Father's right hand
- Will return to judge the living and the dead
- Reigns as King over all creation

### Salvation
- By grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone
- Good works are the fruit, not the root, of salvation
- The Church is the body of Christ, His presence on earth
- Baptism and the Lord's Supper are means of grace

### Last Things
- Christ will return visibly and gloriously
- The dead will be raised
- Final judgment for all
- New heavens and new earth for the redeemed
- Eternal separation from God for the unrepentant

## Hermeneutical Principles

1. **Christocentric**: All Scripture points to Christ (Luke 24:27)
2. **Contextual**: Verses must be read in their literary and historical context
3. **Canonical**: Individual verses interpreted by the whole of Scripture
4. **Traditional**: The historic interpretation of the Church has weight
5. **Doctrinal**: Scripture does not contradict itself; apparent contradictions invite deeper study
6. **Devotional**: Scripture is meant to transform, not merely inform

## What This Means for Verse Selection

- We do not proof-text or take verses out of context
- We acknowledge the progressive revelation of God's plan
- We read the Old Testament through the lens of Christ's fulfillment
- We prioritize texts that have been recognized as canonical and authoritative
- We respect the diversity of genres (history, poetry, prophecy, epistle, apocalyptic)
- We avoid speculative or novel interpretations

## What We Reject

- Denial of the Trinity
- Denial of Christ's full divinity or full humanity
- Denial of the physical resurrection
- Denial of Christ's return and final judgment
- Scripture as merely human wisdom or myth
- Salvation by works or universalism
- Progressive revelation that contradicts historic Christian faith
