# Sentry Mode - Complete Guide

Three-tier webcam surveillance system with AI analysis and visual fingerprinting.

## The Three Tiers

### Tier 1: One-Shot Analysis
**Ask a question, get an instant answer**

```bash
node scripts/sentry-mode.js activate --query "Is anyone in the room?"
```

- Records 3-5 second video
- Extracts key frames
- Analyzes with vision AI
- Returns immediate report

**Use for:** Quick checks, "what's happening now?"

---

### Tier 2: Continuous Monitoring (Three Report Modes)

#### Mode A: Report-All
```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-all --cooldown 30
```
Alert on ANY motion detected.

#### Mode B: Report-Suspicious
```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-suspicious --cooldown 120
```
Alert only on suspicious keywords: weapons, breaking, running, etc.

#### Mode C: Report-Match (Strict Text-Based)
```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-match --cooldown 60
```
Alert ONLY when exact BOLO description matches ALL features.

Example BOLOs:
- "Blonde girl with glasses" (won't trigger without glasses)
- "Blue sedan with license plate ABC123" (must match all)
- "Man with black hat and red jacket" (requires both)

**Use for:** Continuous surveillance with specific targets

---

### Tier 3: Image BOLO (Visual Fingerprinting)

**Upload a photo** → Extract detailed features → Match at any angle/lighting

#### Step 1: Analyze Reference Image
```bash
node scripts/image-bolo-analyzer.js photo.jpg "Name" [type]
```

Types: `person`, `vehicle`, `object`, `auto-detect`

**Examples:**
```bash
# Analyze person photo
node scripts/image-bolo-analyzer.js sarah.jpg "Sarah" person

# Analyze car photo
node scripts/image-bolo-analyzer.js blue-car.jpg "Blue Toyota" vehicle

# Analyze object photo
node scripts/image-bolo-analyzer.js gun.jpg "Black Pistol" object
```

**Output:** Generates `sarah-bolo.json` with:
- Critical features (moles, scars, license plate, damage)
- High priority (hair color, eye color, vehicle type, color)
- Medium priority (clothing, accessories)
- Low priority (pose, expression)

#### Step 2: Use Image BOLO for Surveillance
```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v3.js report-match --bolo sarah-bolo.json
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Faster checking
node scripts/sentry-watch-v3.js report-match \
  --bolo sarah-bolo.json \
  --cooldown 30 \
  --interval 1000

# Slower, less CPU
node scripts/sentry-watch-v3.js report-match \
  --bolo sarah-bolo.json \
  --cooldown 300 \
  --interval 5000
```

**Use for:** Specific person/vehicle/object identification

## Decision Tree: Which Mode to Use

```
Do you have a photo of what you're looking for?
├─ YES → Use Tier 3 (Image BOLO)
│   └─ Most accurate, handles angle/lighting
│
└─ NO → Do you need continuous monitoring?
    ├─ NO → Use Tier 1 (One-Shot Analysis)
    │   └─ Quick answer, instant report
    │
    └─ YES → What triggers should alert you?
        ├─ Anything that moves → Tier 2 Mode A (report-all)
        │   └─ Every motion triggers alert
        │
        ├─ Only suspicious activity → Tier 2 Mode B (report-suspicious)
        │   └─ Weapons, breaking, running, etc.
        │
        └─ Only specific descriptions → Tier 2 Mode C (report-match)
            └─ "Blonde girl with glasses" etc.
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Find Missing Person

**You have a photo of Sarah**

```bash
# 1. Create visual fingerprint
node scripts/image-bolo-analyzer.js sarah.jpg "Sarah" person

# 2. Start surveillance
node scripts/sentry-watch-v3.js report-match --bolo sarah-bolo.json --cooldown 60

# Extracts: mole on cheek, freckles, blonde hair, blue eyes
# Will match Sarah from any angle, any lighting
# Won't match similar-looking people without her distinctive marks
```

### Scenario 2: Track Stolen Car

**You have a photo of your blue Toyota**

```bash
# 1. Analyze car image
node scripts/image-bolo-analyzer.js my-car.jpg "Blue Toyota ABC123" vehicle

# 2. Start monitoring parking lots/streets
node scripts/sentry-watch-v3.js report-match --bolo blue-toyota-bolo.json

# Extracts: license plate, color, model, dent on fender
# Will match your specific car
# Won't match similar cars without the dent or different plate
```

### Scenario 3: Security Monitoring

**Need to know if anyone approaches**

```bash
# Report suspicious activity only
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-suspicious --cooldown 120

# Alerts on: weapons, breaking in, forced entry, running, etc.
# Ignores normal activity
```

### Scenario 4: General Workspace Monitoring

**Quick status checks**

```bash
# "Is anyone in my office?"
node scripts/sentry-mode.js activate --query "Is anyone in my office?"

# "What's on the whiteboard?"
node scripts/sentry-mode.js activate --query "What's written on the whiteboard?"

# "Are the windows open?"
node scripts/sentry-mode.js activate --query "Are any windows open?"
```

## Workflow Examples

### Find Missing Person (Photo Available)

```bash
# 1. Analyze their photo
node scripts/image-bolo-analyzer.js person.jpg "John" person
# → Creates john-bolo.json

# 2. Review critical features
# Output shows: eye color, hair, distinctive marks, etc.

# 3. Start searching
node scripts/sentry-watch-v3.js report-match --bolo john-bolo.json --cooldown 60

# 4. Get alerts when John is detected
# Will match across angles, lighting, different clothing
```

### Monitor for Threats

```bash
# Just alert on suspicious activity
