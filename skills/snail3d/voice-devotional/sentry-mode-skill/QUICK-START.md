# Sentry Mode - Quick Start

## Three Ways to Monitor

### 1. Alert on ANY Motion
```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-all
```
Triggers on everything. Good for general surveillance.

### 2. Alert on Suspicious Activity
```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-suspicious
```
Only triggers on: weapons, running, fighting, breaking in, forced entry, etc.

### 3. Alert on Exact BOLO Match
```bash
node scripts/sentry-watch-v2.js report-match
```
**Only triggers when ALL features match exactly.**

---

## BOLO Examples

### ✅ These trigger:
```
"blonde girl with glasses"
↓ Detects: blonde girl wearing glasses ✓
"man with black hat"
↓ Detects: man in black hat ✓
"blue sedan with license plate ABC123"
↓ Detects: blue sedan, plate ABC123 ✓
```

### ❌ These DON'T trigger:
```
"blonde girl with glasses"
↓ Detects: blonde girl (no glasses) ✗

"man with black hat"
↓ Detects: man in blue hat ✗

"blue sedan with license plate ABC123"
↓ Detects: blue sedan with plate XYZ123 ✗
```
