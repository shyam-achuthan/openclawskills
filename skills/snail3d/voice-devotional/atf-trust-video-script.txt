Breaking News for Gun Owners: The 200 Dollar Tax Stamp Is Gone.

As of January 1st, 2026, the ATF has eliminated the two hundred dollar tax stamp requirement for both eForm 1 and eForm 4 applications. This applies to individuals AND trusts.

What does this mean? If you've been waiting to file for a suppressor, short-barreled rifle, or any NFA item—the financial barrier just disappeared.

But here's what most people don't realize: there's never been a better time to set up a trust.

Current ATF processing times are moving faster than ever. eForm 1 applications are being approved in just 24 to 48 hours. eForm 4 submissions are processing in 40 to 60 days on average. Some are even faster.

A trust gives you something no individual application can: flexibility. Multiple users. Easier transfers. No fingerprints. No photos. No problems.

Without the two hundred dollar tax stamp hanging over your head, the cost of a trust is now the smartest investment you can make for your NFA collection.
