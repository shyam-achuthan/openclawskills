# Example: Odin — The Price of Wisdom

📜 **Hávamál (Sayings of the High One) — Poetic Edda, ~10th century**

> *"Veit ek, at ek hekk vindgameiði á nætr allar níu, geiri undaðr ok gefinn Óðni, sjalfr sjalfum mér"*
> — Hávamál, Stanza 138

🌍 "I know that I hung on a wind-swept tree for nine full nights, pierced by a spear and given to Odin — myself to myself."

**The Story:** Odin, the Allfather of Norse mythology, is not your typical king-of-the-gods. Zeus throws lightning bolts from a throne. Odin hangs himself from Yggdrasil — the World Tree — for nine days and nine nights, pierced by his own spear, without food or water. Why? To gain the knowledge of runes. He literally sacrifices himself to himself. He also traded one of his eyes for a drink from Mimir's Well of Wisdom. The Norse didn't worship a god who had it easy — they worshipped one who paid for everything he knew. Every piece of wisdom cost him something: an eye, nine days of agony, his pride. And here's the kicker — even with all that knowledge, Odin knows he will die at Ragnarök, swallowed by the wolf Fenrir. He gains wisdom knowing it won't save him.

💡 **Modern Connection:** The "Odin trade" is everywhere: you can't learn without paying. Dropping out of college (Jobs, Zuckerberg) = trading one eye for a different kind of sight. Burning through savings to build a company = hanging from the tree. The Norse understood something Silicon Valley often doesn't — wisdom isn't free content, it's scar tissue. The best engineers aren't the ones with the most certificates, they're the ones who've been on-call during a production meltdown at 3am. Every outage is a night on Yggdrasil. And Odin knowing he'll still lose at Ragnarök? That's the founder who builds knowing the startup will probably fail — but the knowledge gained is the actual product.
