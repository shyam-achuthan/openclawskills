🧵 **The man who broke gold** (1/5)

In 1324, Mansa Musa of Mali went on Hajj to Mecca. He brought 60,000 men, 12,000 slaves each carrying 4 pounds of gold, and 80 camels each carrying 300 pounds of gold.

That's roughly $500 billion in today's money. Walking across the Sahara.

(2/5) He gave away so much gold in Cairo that he crashed the Egyptian economy. Gold prices didn't recover for 12 years. One man's *generosity* caused more economic damage than most wars.

(3/5) European mapmakers were so stunned they put him on the Catalan Atlas of 1375 — a Black African king sitting on a golden throne, holding a gold nugget, dominating the map of the known world.

At a time when Europe was dying of plague.

(4/5) The crazy part? He felt bad about crashing Cairo's economy. On his way back, he *borrowed* gold at high interest to remove it from circulation — essentially inventing quantitative tightening. In 1324.

(5/5) Mansa Musa built the Djinguereber Mosque and the University of Sankore in Timbuktu — which had a larger library than any European university at the time.

The richest human who ever lived used his wealth to build schools.

That's the thread. That's the lesson.
