# Example: Gilgamesh — The Oldest Story

📜 **The Epic of Gilgamesh — Sumer/Akkad, ~2100 BC**

> *"šá na-an-din ba-la-ṭam a-na a-wi-lim, im-ta-na-aš-ši-šu ša-a-ri"*
> — Tablet X, Siduri's words

🌍 "When the gods created mankind, they allotted death to mankind, and kept life for themselves."

**The Story:** Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is two-thirds god and one-third human. When his closest friend Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh breaks — he cannot accept mortality. He travels to the edge of the world to find Utnapishtim, the one human granted eternal life, and asks for the secret. Utnapishtim gives him a test: "Stay awake for six days and six nights." Gilgamesh fails — he falls asleep almost immediately. Still, Utnapishtim takes pity and tells him about a plant at the bottom of the sea that restores youth. Gilgamesh dives, finds it, holds it. On the way home, he stops to bathe in a pool. A snake steals the plant. (This is why snakes shed their skin — they got the immortality we lost.) Gilgamesh returns to Uruk empty-handed. But looking at the city walls he built, he understands: immortality isn't in a plant. It's in what you leave behind.

💡 **Modern Connection:** Humanity's first written story is a "pivoting after failure" narrative. Gilgamesh's 4,000-year-old journey: (1) chase product-market fit, (2) find it, (3) lose it to a snake, (4) come home and realize what you already had was the point. Paul Graham's "do things that don't scale" and Gilgamesh's city walls teach the same lesson — what lasts isn't the magic shortcut, it's the thing you built brick by brick. The "snake stole the plant" moment is every founder's nightmare: launch day, and a competitor drops the same feature. And the oldest story ever written is, at its core, about accepting that some problems can't be solved — only lived with.
