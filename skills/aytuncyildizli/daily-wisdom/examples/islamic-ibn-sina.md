# Example: Ibn Sina — The Canon of Medicine

📜 **Abū Alī al-Ḥusayn ibn Sīnā — Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb, ~1025**

> *"الوَهمُ نِصفُ الدّاءِ، والاطمِئنانُ نِصفُ الدّواءِ، والصّبرُ أوّلُ خُطُواتِ الشّفاءِ"*
> — Attributed to Ibn Sina

🌍 "Anxiety is half the illness, peace of mind is half the cure, and patience is the first step to recovery."

**The Story:** In 1025, in the city of Hamadan in present-day Iran, a 45-year-old polymath completed a five-volume medical encyclopedia. This book — the Canon of Medicine — would remain the standard medical textbook from Europe to China for the next 600 years. Ibn Sina's life reads like an impossible résumé: memorized the Quran by age 10, practicing physician by 16, claimed at 18 he had "nothing left to learn." In the Canon, he formulated the concept of quarantine for the first time, wrote that diseases could spread through water and soil (800 years before germ theory), and devised an experiment to prove that psychological state affects physical health. The experiment: he measured a patient's pulse while reading city names aloud. When the pulse spiked at a particular city, he then read street names from that city. Then names of people on that street. Diagnosis: lovesickness. The patient was in love with someone from that address. This is the first documented biofeedback experiment in history — and the instrument was his finger.

💡 **Modern Connection:** Ibn Sina's "anxiety is half the illness" finding was scientifically confirmed in the 2020s by nocebo effect research — the mere expectation of side effects physically creates them. His pulse-based love diagnosis is literally the first lie detector and the first biometric health monitor. Apple Watch heart rate tracking, Oura Ring stress measurement — we're using sensors to do what Ibn Sina did with a fingertip in 1025. And the Canon being used as a university textbook until the 1650s? That's 625 years. No modern textbook comes even close to that record.
