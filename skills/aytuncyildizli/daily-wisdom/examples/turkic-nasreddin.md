# Example: Nasreddin Hoca — The Lake and the Yogurt

📜 **Nasreddin Hoca — Anatolian Folk Tradition, ~13th century**

> *"Ya tutarsa?"*
> — Nasreddin Hoca, stirring yogurt into a lake

🌍 "What if it works?"

**The Story:** One day, a neighbor spotted Nasreddin Hoca crouching at the edge of a lake, spooning yogurt into the water. "Hoca, what are you doing?" The Hoca replied calmly: "I'm fermenting the lake." The neighbor laughed: "A lake can't turn into yogurt!" Hoca shrugged and said three words: "Ya tutarsa?" — "What if it works?" Those three words became one of the most quoted phrases in Anatolian wisdom. But the real genius of Nasreddin Hoca goes deeper: he's a wise man disguised as a fool. Living through the Mongol invasions, the collapse of the Seljuk state, and constant warfare, Hoca's stories gave people both comfort and resistance. He answered power with humor, absurdity with absurdity, and hopelessness with irrational optimism. Is spooning yogurt into a lake absurd? Yes. But is giving up smarter?

💡 **Modern Connection:** "What if it works?" — the world's shortest lean startup manifesto. Every Y Combinator application, every garage project, every "nobody will use this" idea runs on these three words. Airbnb: "Will strangers sleep in each other's homes? What if it works?" Bitcoin: "Can money exist without a government? What if it works?" SpaceX: "Can a rocket land itself? What if it works?" Hoca's neighbor is the voice in every founder's head — the "reasonable" person who explains why it can't work. And for 800 years, history has sided with the man spooning yogurt into a lake, not with the neighbor who laughed.
