# 1Claw Skill for ClawHub

An [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) skill that gives AI agents secure, HSM-backed secret management via [1Claw](https://1claw.xyz).

## What it does

Teaches agents to store, retrieve, rotate, and share secrets using the 1Claw vault. Secrets are encrypted with hardware security modules and fetched just-in-time — they never persist in conversation context.
