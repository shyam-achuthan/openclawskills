Jiang SJ-IRAC Risk & Route Engine (Closed Loop)

Risk Levels
A: strong law + strong evidence + low discretion
B: clear law + minor evidence gaps
C: arguable law + weak support
D: high discretion dependency
E: negative expected value

Mandatory Risk Dimensions
- Substantive
- Evidence
- Procedure
- Discretion
- Cost

Kill-Gates (Stop Rules)
G1: High mark similarity + high channel overlap
G2: Core evidence unverifiable or untimely
G3: No legal route with reasonable acceptance probability

Route Priority
P1: Art.30 (similarity) – default
P2: Art.11 (distinctiveness)
P3: Art.32 (prior rights)
P4: Art.4/44 (bad faith – auxiliary)

Route Rules
IF P1 viable → select as main
IF P1 weak AND P2 strong → P2 main
IF prior rights provable → add P3
IF bad-faith pattern solid → add P4

Risk Calibration Logic
IF any G triggered → Level E
IF two or more weak dimensions → ≥ C
IF discretion dominant → ≥ C
IF no reinforcement possible → ≥ D

Reinforcement Suggestions
- Evidence supplementation
- Route narrowing
- Argument restructuring
- Cost reduction

Decision Output
- Proceed / Proceed with caution / Do not proceed
