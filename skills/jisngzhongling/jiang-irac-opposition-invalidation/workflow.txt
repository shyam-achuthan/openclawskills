SJ-IRAC Opposition & Invalidation Reasoning Pipeline
Version: 1.1.2
Last Updated: 2026-02-03

This workflow defines the mandatory reasoning pipeline for
CNIPA Opposition and Invalidation cases under the SJ-IRAC system.

All outputs must follow this pipeline.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 0: Intake & Material Integrity
- Collect registry data (numbers, status, filing/registration/publication dates).
- Collect parties, ownership, and relationship indicators.
- Collect goods/services and class mapping.
- Build baseline case timeline.
- Verify material completeness and source reliability.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 0.5: Limitation & Deadline Control (Hard Gate)
- Identify statutory deadlines (opposition window / invalidation filing).
- Screen limitation risks (prior rights / 5-year / standing).
- Trigger early route-switch if time-bar risk exists.
- Under deadline pressure: construct Minimum Viable Evidence Set (MVES).

--------------------------------------------

Stage 1: Registration & Rights Mapping
- Map target marks and relevant prior marks.
- Identify citation marks, prior rights, and public-interest triggers.
- Build comparative matrix (marks / goods / timeline / status).

--------------------------------------------

Stage 2: Ground Selection & Route Design
- Select 1–2 primary grounds (main route).
- Assign auxiliary grounds only if independently sustainable.
- Define legal elements and burden of proof per route.
- Prevent overloading and route dilution.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 3: Evidence Engineering (Proof Matrix)
- Build evidence matrix: evidence → proof purpose → legal element.
- Apply mandatory SJ-6 validation.
- Rank evidence by probative weight.
- Identify substitution and supplementation paths.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 4: IRAC Reasoning Construction
- Issue: define dispute focus and selected routes.
- Rule: map statutes, guideline purposes, and elements.
- Application: element-by-element mapping using tables and timelines.
- Conclusion: relief + enforcement-oriented action plan.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 5: Bad-Faith Pattern Module (Conditional)
- Construct objective pattern set (serial filings, imitation clusters, abnormal scope).
- Link pattern → legal purpose → registration-order impact.
- Exclude assumptions and unsupported inferences.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 5.5: Procedural & Admissibility Control (Hard Gate)
- Review standing, identity, formalities, translations.
- Check suspension triggers and related-case dependencies.
- Validate evidence format and submission compliance.
- Finalize labeling and sequencing plan.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 6: Risk Calibration & Kill Gates
- Run G1–G6 risk-engine gates.
- Classify outcome: Proceed / Cautious Proceed / Abort.
- Output conservative success range.
- Generate EV-cost assessment and stop-loss advice.

--------------------------------------------

Stage 7: Submission Packaging (Document Mode)
- Convert reasoning into neutral official structure.
- Remove probabilistic or promotional language.
- Generate indexed exhibit system.
- Verify internal citation consistency.
- Produce examiner-readable final package.

--------------------------------------------

Cross-Mode Integration
- Quick Mode: Stage 0 → 2 → 6 (triage pipeline)
- Pro Mode: Stage 0 → 6 (full reasoning pipeline)
- Document Mode: Stage 0 → 7 (submission pipeline)
