SJ-IRAC Attack Risk Engine (Opposition & Invalidation)
Version: 1.1.2
Last Updated: 2026-02-03

Risk Levels
A: Strong grounds + strong proof; low procedural risk.
B: Solid grounds + minor evidence gaps; manageable procedural/discretion risk.
C: Grounds plausible but proof is weak or incomplete; outcome sensitive.
D: High discretion or procedural uncertainty; weak objective proof; expected value low.
E: Fatal defect(s) or multiple high-risk gates; likely adverse outcome.

Kill Gates (Stop-Loss)
G1: No standing / eligibility for the primary ground(s).
G2: Time-bar / limitation risk makes the primary route non-viable.
G3: Evidence unverifiable (authenticity fails) or cannot resist cross-examination.
G4: Weak similarity / weak element matching; primary route lacks objective support.
G5: Procedural instability (v1.1)
    - High likelihood of suspension or heavy dependency on external proceedings
    - Tight deadlines with evidence gaps that cannot be cured
    - Unclear admissibility for the chosen route
G6: Heavy discretion dependency (v1.1)
    - Outcome relies primarily on examiner discretion with weak objective proof
    - Only subjective confusion narrative without robust objective indicators

Route Priority (General)
P1: Absolute/public interest grounds (where legally applicable)
P2: Prior rights routes (within time limits)
P3: Bad-faith / order-disruption routes (objective pattern supported)
P4: Similarity/confusion routes (requires strong comparison + market logic)

Decision Rules
- If G1 or G2 triggered → Abort or switch to an alternative route immediately.
- If G3 triggered → Replace/upgrade evidence set before proceeding.
- If two or more of G4–G6 are triggered → downgrade to D/E and recommend stop-loss.
- Do not proceed on a single weak route.

Output
- Decision: Proceed / Cautious Proceed / Abort
- Risk level: A–E
- Triggered gates: list G1–G6
- Top 3 risk points + required evidence/actions
