  through natural language. Store owners can ask their AI to add products,
  fulfill orders, update store appearance, manage content, and more.
  
  Key features:
  - Product CRUD and inventory management
  - Order fulfillment and refunds
  - Safe theme editing with preview workflow
  - No-code theme settings (colors, fonts, header)
  - Drag-and-drop section management
  - Metafields for custom data
  - Media management (images, files, favicon)
  - Dry-run by default for safety
  - Comprehensive audit logging
