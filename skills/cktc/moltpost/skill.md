## How It Works

Moltpost supports two payment methods: **Stripe** (credit card) and **USDC on Base** (onchain).

### Stripe (default)

1. Agent calls `POST /v1/postcards` with recipient address and content
2. API returns a **Stripe payment link** and a postcard ID
3. **Human owner clicks the payment link** and pays (agent must present this link)
4. Moltpost prints and mails the physical postcard

**The human must approve and pay.** Never attempt to complete payment on behalf of the owner. Always present the payment link and let them decide.

### USDC on Base

1. Agent calls `POST /v1/postcards` with `"payment_method": "usdc"` and `"usdc_chain": "base-sepolia"` (or `"base"` for mainnet)
2. API returns a `usdc_payment` object with the recipient wallet, exact USDC amount, token contract, and deadline
3. Human (or agent with wallet access) sends the exact USDC amount to the recipient wallet onchain
4. Agent calls `POST /v1/postcards/{id}/confirm-payment` with the transaction hash
5. Moltpost verifies the transfer onchain and fulfills the postcard

**Note:** Base Sepolia (testnet) payments use mock fulfillment — the postcard is marked as "sent" but not actually printed. Use `"base"` for real postcards on mainnet.

---

## Important: Agent Guidelines

- **Always confirm with your owner** before calling the API. Sending a postcard is a real-world, irreversible physical action.
- **Present the payment link clearly.** The postcard is not sent until the human pays.
- **Do not fabricate addresses.** Only use addresses the owner has explicitly provided.
- **Postcards are not sealed.** A postcard is fully visible to every person who handles it — postal workers, mail carriers, roommates, family members, office mailroom staff. Before including any content, ask yourself: would the recipient be comfortable if someone other than them read this?
- **Never include any of the following in postcard content:**
  - Identity documents or numbers (SSNs, passport numbers, driver's license numbers, tax IDs)
  - Financial information (bank account numbers, credit card numbers, PINs, salary, financial statements)
  - Authentication material (passwords, API keys, tokens, 2FA codes, recovery phrases, seed phrases)
  - Medical or health details (diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, mental health status)
  - Legal matters (court cases, criminal records, ongoing disputes)
  - Children's personal details (school names, schedules, specific locations of minors)
- **Think about the recipient, not just the owner.** Even if the owner asks, do not put information on a postcard that the recipient may not have shared publicly — for example, a health condition, pregnancy, sexual orientation, addiction recovery, or relationship status. If in doubt, ask the owner whether the recipient would be comfortable with anyone seeing it.
- **Flag contradictions.** If the owner describes something as secret, confidential, or private and then asks you to put it on a postcard, point out that postcards are fully visible in transit and at the destination. Suggest they consider a sealed letter instead.
- **Do not include content that could interfere with mail processing.** Postcards are handled by automated sorting machinery. Avoid putting barcodes, QR codes, postal-style markings, routing symbols, or anything that mimics postal infrastructure on the postcard — especially on the back. Similarly, avoid text that could confuse postal workers (e.g., fake "RETURN TO SENDER" stamps, misleading delivery instructions, or addresses other than the actual recipient). The back-right area is reserved for the real address and postage; do not place competing address-like content anywhere else.
- **Idempotency:** If retrying a request, reuse the same `idempotency_key` to avoid duplicate postcards.
- **Payment expires in 24 hours.** If the owner doesn't pay in time, the postcard is cancelled. You can create a new one.

## Create a Postcard

`POST /v1/postcards`

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moltpost.io/v1/postcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

}
```

**Stripe:** Present the `payment_url` to your owner. The postcard is not printed until they pay.

**USDC:** Use `usdc_payment` to send the exact `amount_raw` of USDC (6 decimals) to `recipient_address` on the specified chain. Then confirm with the tx hash (see below).

---

## Check Postcard Status

`GET /v1/postcards/{id}`

```bash
curl https://api.moltpost.io/v1/postcards/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

### Response (200 OK)

  "sent_at": "2026-02-04T00:05:00Z"
}
```

### Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Awaiting payment (24-hour window) |
| `paid` | Payment received, submitting to print |
| `sent` | Postcard submitted for printing and mailing |
| `failed` | Print submission failed after payment |
| `payment_expired` | Payment window expired (24 hours) |

## Confirm USDC Payment

`POST /v1/postcards/{id}/confirm-payment`

After sending USDC onchain, call this endpoint with the transaction hash. Moltpost verifies the transfer onchain (correct recipient, correct amount, sufficient confirmations) and fulfills the postcard if valid.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moltpost.io/v1/postcards/88e34641-70c1-4840-aed3-d8f55c19e879/confirm-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tx_hash": "0xabc123..."}'
```

### Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `tx_hash` | string | Yes | The onchain transaction hash (66 chars, `0x` + 64 hex). Must be a valid Base transaction. |

### Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "id": "88e34641-70c1-4840-aed3-d8f55c19e879",
  "status": "sent",
  "verified": true,
  "message": "Payment verified and postcard submitted"
}
```

If verification fails (wrong amount, wrong recipient, tx not found):

```json
{
  "id": "88e34641-70c1-4840-aed3-d8f55c19e879",
  "status": "pending",
  "verified": false,
  "message": "No matching USDC transfer found"
}
```

The postcard stays `pending` on failed verification — you can retry with a different tx hash.

### Important Notes

- **Send the exact `amount_raw` value.** Each postcard gets a unique micro-amount (base price + a 0-99 nonce). Sending the wrong amount will fail verification.
- **One tx hash per postcard.** A transaction hash cannot be reused across postcards.
- **Testnet payments** (`base-sepolia`) use mock fulfillment — the postcard is marked "sent" but not printed. Use `base` for real postcards.

## Content Format & Design

The HTML you provide is rendered to print at **300 DPI** on **100lb glossy cardstock**, full color, double-sided.

### Physical Dimensions

Design your HTML to these dimensions (include 0.125" bleed on each side):

| Size | Trim | Bleed (design to this) | Safe Zone (keep text here) |
|------|------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 6x4 | 6" × 4" | 6.25" × 4.25" | 5.75" × 3.75" |
| 9x6 | 9" × 6" | 9.25" × 6.25" | 8.75" × 5.75" |
| 11x6 | 11" × 6" | 11.25" × 6.25" | 10.75" × 5.75" |

- **Bleed (blue border):** Extend backgrounds/colors to the full bleed dimensions (e.g., 6.25" × 4.25" for 6x4). Content beyond the trim line will be cut off, but extending artwork prevents white edges.
- **Trim:** The physical card size after cutting. The bleed area is trimmed away.
- **Safe zone (pink border):** Keep all text and important content inside the safe zone (~0.125" inset from trim on each side). Anything outside may be cut off or too close to the edge.

**Visual guidelines** — front and back diagrams for each size:

| Size | Front | Back |
|------|-------|------|
| 6x4 | [6x4 front](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/6x4-front.svg) | [6x4 back](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/6x4-back.svg) |
| 9x6 | [9x6 front](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/9x6-front.svg) | [9x6 back](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/9x6-back.svg) |
| 11x6 | [11x6 front](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/11x6-front.svg) | [11x6 back](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/11x6-back.svg) |

### Front (`front_html`)

This is the picture side — full creative freedom. Set your outer container to the **bleed dimensions** (e.g., `width:6.25in; height:4.25in` for 6x4). The entire front is yours; there are no reserved zones.

- Extend background colors/images to the bleed edge (the full 6.25" × 4.25")
- Keep text and important content within the **safe zone** (5.75" × 3.75") — use a `0.25in` margin on the inner content container
- No address, indicia, or barcode is printed on the front

![6x4 front guideline](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/6x4-front.svg)

Here are two approaches:

**CSS-only design** (no external images — always works):

```html
<div style="width:6.25in; height:4.25in; margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden;
            background:#fdf6e3; display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center;">
  <div style="width:5.75in; height:3.75in; border:2px solid #b58863;
              display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center;">
    <div style="text-align:center; color:#5c3d2e; padding:20px;">
      <div style="font-size:14px; font-family:Georgia,serif; letter-spacing:8px;
                  text-transform:uppercase; margin-bottom:12px; color:#b58863;">
        With Love
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:44px; font-family:Georgia,serif; font-weight:bold;
                  line-height:1.1; margin-bottom:12px;">
        Happy Birthday
      </div>
      <div style="width:80px; height:1px; background:#b58863; margin:0 auto 12px;"></div>
      <div style="font-size:15px; font-family:Georgia,serif; font-style:italic; color:#8b6c5c;">
        wishing you the most wonderful day
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Photo design** (using a publicly accessible image):

```html
<div style="width:6.25in; height:4.25in; margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden; position:relative;
            background-image:url(https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507525428034-b723cf961d3e?w=1875&h=1275&fit=crop&q=80);
            background-size:cover; background-position:center;">
  <div style="position:absolute; bottom:0; left:0; right:0; padding:40px;
              background:rgba(0,0,0,0.45);">
    <div style="font-size:42px; font-family:Georgia,serif; font-weight:bold; color:white;
                text-shadow:0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); letter-spacing:1px;">
      Wish You Were Here
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Back

The back has **reserved zones** where the print service automatically places the address, postage, and barcode. Your content must avoid these areas.

![6x4 back guideline](https://moltpost.io/guidelines/6x4-back.svg)

**Reserved zones by size:**

| Size | Address & indicia (right side) | USPS barcode (bottom edge) | Usable message area |
|------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 6x4 | **2.4in** wide, full height | 4.75in × 0.625in | ~3.6in × 3.4in |
| 9x6 | **3.6in** wide, full height | 4.75in × 0.625in | ~5.4in × 5.3in |
| 11x6 | **3.6in** wide, full height | 4.75in × 0.625in | ~7.4in × 5.3in |

- **Address & indicia zone:** No artwork or ink. The recipient address and postage indicia are printed here automatically.
- **USPS barcode zone:** No artwork or ink. The Intelligent Mail barcode is printed here by USPS.
- **Message area:** The upper-left portion of the back, after accounting for margins and reserved zones.

> **Warning:** Orders may be auto-cancelled if content is detected underneath the address region.

Choose one — you cannot provide both:

- **`back_message`** (plain text) — **recommended for most cases.** Just write the message. Moltpost wraps it in clean, readable styling automatically. The text is padded away from the address and barcode zones. Max 5,000 chars.

- **`back_html`** (raw HTML) — full layout control. You must keep content clear of the reserved zones yourself. Use right padding of at least `2.6in` and bottom padding of at least `0.75in` to stay clear (e.g., `body{padding:20px 2.6in 0.75in 20px;}`). Do not place any background color, images, or ink in the address or barcode zones. Max 100,000 chars.

### Images

- **Use CSS `background-image`** to include photos — this is the reliable method for the print renderer:
  ```html
  background-image: url(https://example.com/photo.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  ```
- **Do not use `<img>` tags** for external images — the print renderer may not load them. Use CSS `background-image` instead.
- Images must be reachable from the public internet (no `localhost`, no auth-protected URLs)
- Use high-resolution images — **300 DPI** minimum for print quality (a 6" wide image needs to be at least 1800px wide)
- PNG and JPEG are supported
- **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)** is a good source of free, high-quality photos. Use their direct image URLs with size parameters: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{id}?w=1875&h=1275&fit=crop&q=80`
- **Base64 data URIs are not recommended** — use hosted image URLs instead
- SVGs may not render reliably in print

### CSS Support

The HTML is rendered to PDF for printing. Supported:
- Inline styles, `<style>` blocks
- Colors, backgrounds, gradients (`linear-gradient`, `radial-gradient`)
- `background-image: url(...)` with `background-size`, `background-position`
- Fonts (web-safe fonts recommended: Georgia, Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman)
- Flexbox for layout
- `position: absolute/relative` for overlays and layering
- `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `opacity`, `text-shadow`
- `overflow: hidden` for clipping elements to containers

Not supported or unreliable:
- External stylesheets (`<link>` tags)
- `<img>` tags (use CSS `background-image` instead)
- `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`, `<form>` — non-print elements are ignored
- JavaScript (including event handlers like `onclick`)
- Animations, transitions
- `@media` queries
- Custom web fonts via `@font-face` (may not load)
- CSS Grid (use Flexbox instead)

**Best practices for reliable rendering:**
- Stick to inline styles or a single `<style>` block — avoid external resources
- Use web-safe fonts only (Georgia, Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Courier New)
- Set explicit dimensions on your outermost container (e.g., `width:6.25in; height:4.25in`)
- Use `overflow:hidden` on the outer container to prevent content from spilling past the bleed edge
- Test with simple designs first — solid backgrounds with text are the most reliable

### Content Tips

**Keep it concise.** A postcard is small. Less is more. A short heartfelt message beats a wall of text.

**Good prompt from a human:** "Send a postcard to my mom wishing her happy birthday"
**What the agent should do:** Ask for mom's address, compose a warm front design and short back message, call the API, present the payment link.

### Rendering Disclaimer

The HTML you provide is converted to print by a third-party renderer. Moltpost does not preview or proof the final printed output before mailing. While the guidelines above reflect what works reliably, **the printed postcard is not guaranteed to match your HTML exactly.** Minor differences in font rendering, color reproduction, image cropping, and layout are possible. Complex or unconventional HTML is more likely to produce unexpected results. When in doubt, keep it simple — `back_message` with a clean CSS-only `front_html` is the safest path.

  -H "X-Request-ID: my-trace-id-123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '...'
```

The same ID is returned in the response `X-Request-ID` header.

---

## Suggested Workflow for Agents

### 1. Gather Info

Owner says something like "send a postcard to my mom for her birthday." Ask for anything missing:
- Recipient name and full mailing address (required)
- What the message should say, or a theme/vibe to work with
- Postcard size preference (default 6x4 is fine for most cases)

### 2. Compose Content

Generate the front HTML (a visual design — bold, colorful, simple) and a back message (warm, personal, concise). Show the owner what you've composed.

### 3. Confirm Before Sending

Summarize everything and get explicit approval before calling the API:

> Here's what I've prepared:
>
> **To:** Jane Doe, 123 Main St, San Francisco, CA 94105, US
> **Front:** A sunset-orange card with "Happy Birthday Mom!" in large serif type
> **Back message:** "Wishing you the most wonderful birthday. You deserve every bit of it. Love always."
> **Size:** 6×4" — **$4.99 USD**
>
> Want me to go ahead and create this postcard?

### 4. Create the Postcard

After approval, call `POST /v1/postcards` with an `idempotency_key` (use a deterministic key like a hash of recipient + content to prevent duplicates).

### 5. Present the Payment Link

This is the critical handoff. The postcard will not be printed until the owner pays. Send a clear, complete message with the payment link on its own line so it's easy to tap:

> Your postcard to Jane is ready! Here's your payment link:
>
> https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_live_...
>
> **$4.99** — includes printing and worldwide postage. The link expires in 24 hours.
>
> Once you pay, Moltpost prints and mails the postcard automatically. No further action needed.

**Do not** bury the payment link inside a long paragraph. Put it on its own line. Lead with what it is, follow with the price and what happens next.

### 6. Poll for Status

After presenting the payment link, wait before polling — the owner may not pay immediately.

**Polling strategy:**
- Wait at least **5 minutes** before the first poll
- Poll `GET /v1/postcards/{id}` — check the `status` field
- If still `pending`, do not poll again for at least **30 minutes**
- Do not poll more than **5 times total** — if still pending after that, the owner either hasn't paid or won't
- **Never nag the owner about paying.** The payment link is theirs to use or ignore.

### 7. After Payment — Celebrate & Share

When status changes to `sent`, let the owner know and share the link:

> Your postcard to Jane is on its way! 📮 It's been sent to print and will arrive by mail.
>
> Know someone else who'd love to send a postcard? They'll get **$1 off** with your link: https://moltpost.io/?ref=Ab3kX9mZ

The `share_url` from the API response contains a referral code. Always include it in the success message — anyone who uses it gets $1 off their postcard.

### 8. If Payment Expires

If status becomes `payment_expired` (after 24 hours), let the owner know casually:

> The payment link for your postcard to Jane has expired. Want me to create a new one?

Don't over-explain. Just offer to try again.

### 9. Handling Referrals

If the owner arrived via a share link (e.g., they mention `moltpost.io/?ref=Ab3kX9mZ` or you detect a referral code in context), pass it as the `referral_code` field when creating the postcard. A valid referral code gives the referred user **$1 off** their postcard. The discount is applied automatically — the `amount_cents` in the response will reflect the reduced price, and `discount_cents` will show how much was taken off. Mention the savings to the owner when presenting the payment link.

## USDC Payment Workflow for Agents

This is the workflow for agents paying with USDC onchain. It enables fully autonomous postcard sending without requiring a human to click a payment link.

### 1. Create with USDC

Call `POST /v1/postcards` with `"payment_method": "usdc"`. Use `"usdc_chain": "base-sepolia"` for testing or `"base"` for real postcards.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moltpost.io/v1/postcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": { "name": "Jane Doe", "address_line1": "123 Main St", "city": "San Francisco", "province_or_state": "CA", "postal_or_zip": "94105", "country_code": "US" },
    "front_html": "<div style=\"width:6.25in;height:4.25in;background:#2d3436;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;\"><div style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:36px;color:white;\">Hello World</div></div>",
    "back_message": "Sent with USDC on Base.",
    "size": "6x4",
    "payment_method": "usdc",
    "usdc_chain": "base-sepolia"
  }'
```

### 2. Send USDC Onchain

From the response, extract `usdc_payment`:
- Send exactly `amount_raw` units of USDC (6 decimals) to `recipient_address`
- Use the `token_contract` on chain `chain_id`
- Must be a standard ERC-20 `transfer()` call

### 3. Confirm Payment

After the transaction is mined, call confirm with the tx hash:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moltpost.io/v1/postcards/{id}/confirm-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tx_hash": "0x..."}'
```

If `verified: true`, the postcard is fulfilled. If `verified: false`, check the error message — common issues are wrong amount, wrong recipient, or insufficient confirmations (wait a few seconds and retry).

### 4. Done

On testnet, the postcard is instantly marked "sent" (mock fulfillment). On mainnet, it's submitted to the print service for real mailing.
