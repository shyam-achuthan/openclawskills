# Lite limits and defaults

- Keep a minimal dependency surface.
- Favor deterministic scripts you already trust over new ad-hoc code.
- Default speaker policy: Dario-style dominant mapping + conservative interviewer reassignment only.
- Translation policy: keep format and timestamps intact.
- When uncertain, leave ambiguous turns unchanged and note them in handoff notes.
