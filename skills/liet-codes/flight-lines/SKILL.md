# Flight Lines

## Theoretical Ground

Knowledge gets organized into **domains**—epidemiology, jazz theory, mycology, contract law. These are stratifications: useful for organizing expertise but not fundamental boundaries. They're territories.

**Operations** exist beneath these strata. "Sentinel surveillance" isn't essentially about disease—it's a capacity: strategic monitoring of high-signal locations in sparse search spaces. "Reharmonization" isn't essentially about jazz—it's changing underlying structure while preserving surface continuity. Operations are **deterritorialized capacities** that got captured by domain-strata through historical accident.

The conventional approach to problems stays within domain boundaries. Dating advice for dating problems. Language pedagogy for language problems. This is navigating along the strata—safe, predictable, limited.

**Lines of flight** are movements that escape stratified territories. When you recognize that rare book dealer "want list circulation" addresses the same structural constraint as epidemiological "contact tracing"—and both could apply to finding collaborators in a new city—you're accessing operations on a **plane of consistency** where domain labels don't constrain what composes with what.

**Key insight**: Operations compose based on structural fit, not semantic coherence. An assemblage of mycorrhizal networks + ham radio + rare book collecting is domain-incoherent but can be structurally coherent for a given problem.

## What This Enables

**Stratified approach:**
- Problem: "I just moved to a new city and want to build a life here"
- Solution space: Networking advice, meetup apps, "put yourself out there"
- Limitation: Stays within conventional self-help territory

**Compositional approach:**
- Identify parallel concerns: shelter/territory, social/connection, work/sustenance, identity/becoming
- For each concern, identify structural constraints (not semantic categories)
- Query for operations addressing those constraints from ANY domain
- Compose operations that work together, revising as structure changes
- Result: Novel assemblage that couldn't emerge from any single domain

## Core Concepts

### Operation

A specific capacity with defined mechanics—not a concept or metaphor:

- **What it acts on**: Input structure
- **What it produces**: Output structure
- **What it preserves**: Invariants under the transformation
- **What it transforms**: What necessarily changes
- **How you execute it**: Concrete procedure

Examples:
- **Sentinel surveillance** (epidemiology): Monitor high-signal nodes to detect sparse events early
- **Mycelial resource sharing** (mycology): Distribute resources through network based on need signals
- **Want list circulation** (rare books): Broadcast specific search criteria through dealer networks
- **CQ calls** (ham radio): General broadcast seeking any responder, establishes who's listening
- **Nurse logs** (forest ecology): Use decaying structure as substrate for new growth
- **Load balancing** (distributed systems): Distribute work across nodes to prevent bottlenecks

### Structural Constraint

A property of the problem that creates difficulty—independent of domain framing:

- Sparse signal in noise (most encounters are mismatches)
- Cold start (no existing network to leverage)
- Resource scarcity (limited time, energy, money)
- Information asymmetry (can't identify compatible parties externally)
- Temporal dynamics (windows of opportunity, decay rates)
- Network topology (fragmented patches, no clear hubs)
- Identity flux (who you're becoming isn't who you were)

### Assemblage

A composition of heterogeneous operations that work together. Assemblages don't require domain coherence—they require **structural coherence**:

- Each operation addresses different constraints
- Operations don't contradict each other
- Together they form executable protocol
- Domain mixing is expected, not anomalous

### Line of Flight

A trajectory that escapes stratified solutions. When standard approaches feel exhausted and you start pulling operations from mycology and espionage and thermodynamics to address your problem—you're following a line of flight.

Not all lines of flight succeed. Some dissipate, some get recaptured by strata, some open genuine new territory.

## The Compositional Method

This is not a linear pipeline. It's an ongoing process with parallel paths and constant revision.

### 1. Map the Terrain

Don't ask "what kind of problem is this?" (that's seeking a stratum to navigate within).

Ask: "What are the parallel concerns here? What structural properties make each one hard?"

**Example: Fresh Start in a New City**

An adult has moved to a new city. They want to build a life—not just survive, but flourish. Not replicate their old life, but become someone new while honoring who they've been.

Parallel concerns identified:
- **Territory**: Physical space, shelter, navigable environment
- **Sustenance**: Income, work, economic participation
- **Connection**: Social bonds, community, belonging
- **Orientation**: Understanding how this place works, its rhythms and norms
- **Becoming**: Identity work—who are you here, without old context?

For each concern, structural constraints:

**Territory constraints:**
- Resource scarcity (housing costs, competition)
- Information asymmetry (locals know what you don't)
- Temporal pressure (need shelter immediately)
- Quality uncertainty (can't assess neighborhood without living there)

**Connection constraints:**
- Cold start (no existing network)
- Sparse matching (most people aren't compatible for deep connection)
- Context collapse (no shared history to build on)
- Activation energy (initiating contact is costly)
- Decay dynamics (new connections fade without maintenance)

**Becoming constraints:**
- Identity flux (old identity doesn't fit, new one not yet formed)
- Legibility gap (others can't read you without context)
- Self-coherence pressure (need continuity while changing)
- Scaffolding absence (no existing structures support new becoming)

### 2. Query for Operations (Broadly)

For each structural constraint, ask: "What operations address this structural property?"

**Don't constrain by domain.** Query across everything you understand.

**Cold start constraint** (no existing network):

Operations that address cold start:
- **Spore dispersal** (mycology): Broadcast widely, most fail, some find substrate
- **CQ calls** (ham radio): General broadcast announcing presence, seeing who responds
- **Seed banks** (ecology): Dormant connections that activate when conditions right
- **Pioneer species** (succession ecology): First colonizers that make environment habitable for others
- **Loss leaders** (retail): Offer value at cost to establish presence, profit comes later

**Sparse matching constraint** (most people aren't compatible):

Operations:
- **Sentinel surveillance** (epidemiology): Monitor high-signal locations rather than random search
- **Want list circulation** (rare books): Broadcast specific criteria to networks, let matches come to you
- **Assortative mixing** (network science): Seek environments where similar nodes cluster
- **Pheromone trails** (entomology): Leave signals that attract compatible others
- **Resonance testing** (acoustics): Send signal, see what vibrates back

**Identity flux constraint** (old identity doesn't fit):

Operations:
- **Nurse logs** (forest ecology): Old structure provides substrate for new growth
- **Molting** (arthropods): Shed constraining exterior, vulnerable period, new form emerges
- **Composting** (soil science): Break down old material into nutrients for new growth
- **Version control** (software): Maintain history while enabling change, can branch and merge
- **Metabolic switching** (biochemistry): Same organism, different mode of operation based on environment

### 3. Compose Assemblages (Parallel Paths)

Don't create one master plan. **Open multiple lines simultaneously.**

**Line A: Territorial Establishment**
- Pioneer species + Nurse logs: Find transitional housing that scaffolds while you learn the terrain
- Sentinel surveillance: Identify high-signal neighborhoods (not "best" neighborhoods—ones that match your becoming)
- Pheromone trails: As you explore, leave traces—become a regular somewhere, let patterns form

**Line B: Network Seeding**
- CQ calls + Spore dispersal: Make presence known broadly—some venues, some online, some professional contexts
- Assortative mixing: Seek environments that pre-filter for compatibility (not "networking events"—specific interest clusters)
- Want list circulation: Tell people specifically what you're looking for (collaborators on X, people interested in Y)

**Line C: Becoming Work**
- Molting + Nurse logs: Let old identity provide nutrients for new one rather than clinging or rejecting
- Version control: Maintain continuity—you're not starting from zero, you're branching
- Metabolic switching: Different contexts may call for different modes (professional you, social you, exploring you)

### 4. Execute and Observe

Run operations. Generate concrete outputs:

**CQ calls executed:**
- Attended three different interest-based gatherings (ceramics studio open house, philosophy reading group, climbing gym)
- Posted in local subreddit introducing yourself with specific interests
- Told everyone you met one specific thing you're looking for

**Sentinel surveillance executed:**
- Identified three "high-signal" locations: the coffee shop where interesting conversations happen, the co-working space with creative energy, the park where your demographic clusters
- Started regular presence at one (become a pattern, not a visitor)

**Want list circulation executed:**
- Told five people: "I'm looking for collaborators interested in [specific thing]"
- Created a simple artifact (blog post, project page, newsletter) that broadcasts your criteria

**Nurse log executed:**
- Brought three objects from old life that carry meaning
- Reached out to two old friends not to maintain old dynamic but to share new becoming
- Identified which skills/knowledge from past are substrate for new growth

### 5. Revise Based on New Structure

Here's where the **composer** aspect becomes dynamic.

Execution changes structure. New structure reveals new constraints. New constraints suggest new operations.

**After two weeks:**

What emerged:
- The philosophy reading group has a subgroup interested in exactly your thing → Line B intensifies here
- Your transitional housing is in a neighborhood that doesn't fit → Line A needs revision
- You're trying to maintain old identity more than you realized → Line C reveals deeper constraint

New constraints revealed:
- **Premature crystallization**: Danger of locking into first connections rather than staying open
- **Energy depletion**: Too many parallel lines, not enough intensity on any
- **Authenticity drag**: Presenting self in ways that attract wrong matches

New operations pulled in:
- **Controlled burns** (forestry): Deliberately clear some undergrowth to allow new growth
- **Dormancy** (botany): Some seeds should wait for better conditions rather than germinating now
- **Impedance matching** (electronics): Adjust your presentation to match the systems you're connecting to

Revised assemblage:
- Narrow from three lines to two (let one go dormant)
- Intensify philosophy group line (impedance match—show up as someone becoming, not someone arrived)
- Controlled burn on housing—actively reject current situation rather than tolerating, reopen search

### 6. Iterate Until Stable (Or Transform the Question)

The process continues until:
- **Stable assemblage**: Operations are working, concerns addressed, sustainable configuration achieved
- **Question transforms**: The becoming work changes what you're even trying to do—you're now asking different questions
- **Reterritorialization**: You've found a new stratum that works—this is fine, not everything needs to stay deterritorialized

The composer doesn't have an end state. It's a way of navigating.

## Principles

### Operations Are Deterritorialized Capacities

"Sentinel surveillance" works whether tracking disease, monitoring rare species, or finding your people in a new city. The operation exists independent of its origin domain.

When you use an operation, you're not doing "epidemiology" in your social life. You're accessing a capacity that epidemiology happened to articulate.

### Compose on Structure, Not Semantics

Mycorrhizal networks + ham radio + rare books is semantically absurd. It can be structurally coherent.

Domain mixing isn't a clever trick—it's the natural result of accessing operations beneath their domain-strata.

### Parallel Lines, Constant Revision

Don't create a master plan and execute it. Open multiple lines. Let some intensify, let some dissipate. Revise as structure changes.

The composer is an ongoing process, not a one-shot planner.

### Execution Produces Structure

You can't fully analyze a problem then solve it. Execution reveals constraints analysis missed. Operations produce structure that suggests new operations.

Think: probe, act, sense, respond. Not: analyze, plan, execute.

### Operations Feed Back

The output of one operation becomes input for selecting the next. "Want list circulation" might surface someone who teaches you about "guild structures" (medieval crafts), which becomes a new operation addressing constraints you hadn't seen.

Domains you didn't know could contribute get pulled in as you go.

### Trust Computational Fidelity

If you can generate concrete outputs—specific actions, real artifacts, actual protocols—the composition is working.

Vague analogies ("my social life is like a mycelial network") aren't operations. Specific procedures ("broadcast specific criteria through existing contacts, let matches come to you") are.

## When to Use This

**Use when:**
- Problem has multiple parallel concerns (not single-axis optimization)
- Standard approaches feel exhausted or constraining
- You sense the problem wants a different kind of solution
- You have operational fluency in seemingly unrelated domains
- You're willing to follow lines that look weird

**Don't use when:**
- Problem is well-served by domain-standard solutions
- Stakes require proven approaches
- You want conventional advice
- Single constraint, obvious operation

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Parallel Lines with Selective Intensification

Open multiple lines. Most won't go anywhere. A few will resonate. Intensify those, let others go dormant or dissipate.

Don't pick one approach and commit. Don't try to optimize everything simultaneously.

### Pattern: Operations Suggest Adjacent Operations

Success with one operation often reveals related ones:
- Sentinel surveillance works → Try network effects, hub identification
- Want list works → Try dealer networks, auction dynamics
- Mycelial sharing works → Try resource gradient sensing, network pruning

Let working operations pull in their neighbors.

### Pattern: Breakdowns Reveal Hidden Constraints

When an operation doesn't quite fit, the friction reveals constraints you missed.

"Stepping stones assumes fixed patches, but my safe spaces are temporally unstable" → Reveals temporal dynamics constraint you hadn't modeled.

Breakdowns are information, not failures.

### Pattern: Reterritorialization Is Fine

Not every line of flight needs to stay deterritorialized. Sometimes you find a new stratum that actually works. A stable job, a solid friend group, a neighborhood that fits.

The goal isn't permanent deterritorialization. It's having the capacity to follow lines of flight when strata aren't working.

### Pattern: Domain Mixing Signals Novelty

If your assemblage composes 4+ unrelated domains, you're probably generating novel approaches.

Homogeneous composition (all operations from one domain) suggests staying within conventional territory. That's fine when it works.

## Extended Example: Fresh Start, Month by Month

**Month 1: Opening Lines**

Territory line: Found temporary housing, started sentinel surveillance on neighborhoods
Connection line: CQ calls across three contexts, want list to five people
Becoming line: Nurse log inventory (what from past is substrate?)

Concrete outputs:
- List of three candidate neighborhoods with visit schedule
- Calendar of recurring events to attend
- Specific criteria being broadcast: "looking for collaborators on X"
- Three objects from old life intentionally placed in new space

**Month 2: Selective Intensification**

What emerged:
- One neighborhood clearly resonates (sentinel surveillance worked)
- Philosophy group subgroup is high-signal (connection line intensifying)
- Old identity patterns stronger than expected (becoming line needs more work)

Revised assemblage:
- Housing search intensifies in one neighborhood (pioneer species: accept imperfect first option there)
- Connection narrows to philosophy group + one other context (dormancy on third)
- New operation: Controlled burns on old patterns (deliberately don't do things old-you would do)

**Month 3: Structure Stabilizes and Transforms**

Territory: Found housing in target neighborhood. Territorial concern moves to background.
Connection: Three genuine connections forming. Network has seed structure.
Becoming: Clearer sense of new version. Some branches merged back, some still open.

New concerns emerging:
- How to deepen connections without premature crystallization
- How to let professional identity evolve alongside personal
- What the relationship is between new-city-you and old connections

New operations being queried:
- **Mycorrhizal resource sharing**: How to contribute to network, not just extract
- **Succession dynamics**: What comes after pioneer phase
- **Grafting** (horticulture): How to connect different branches of identity

The problem has transformed. You're no longer "starting fresh"—you're in the next phase. The composer continues.

## Relationship to Other Approaches

**vs. Self-help / Life coaching:**
Self-help stays within its stratum. "Network more." "Put yourself out there." Flight lines pull operations from mycology and ham radio and epidemiology.

**vs. Analogical reasoning:**
Analogies map concepts. "My social life is like a garden." Flight lines execute operations. "Apply succession dynamics: pioneer species first, then guilds."

**vs. Design thinking:**
Design thinking iterates within problem domain. Flight lines compose across domains based on structural fit.

**vs. Systems thinking:**
Systems thinking analyzes dynamics within a frame. Flight lines escape frames entirely.

## Key Takeaway

Operations exist beneath domain-strata as deterritorialized capacities. When problems resist stratified solutions, you can follow lines of flight by composing operations based on structural fit rather than semantic coherence.

The composer maintains parallel lines, intensifying some and letting others dissipate, constantly revising as execution produces new structure. It's not a planning method—it's a way of navigating.

Domain boundaries are real but not fundamental. Operations transcend them. Compose boldly, revise constantly, trust what produces concrete outputs.
